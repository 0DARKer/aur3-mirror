Version 5.1.3

	Fixed an authentication bypass vulnerability triggered by rekeying an
	unestablished IKE_SA while it gets actively initiated. This allowed an
	attacker to trick a peer's IKE_SA state to established, without the need to
	provide any valid authentication credentials. The vulnerability has been
	registered as CVE-2014-2338. Refer to our blog for details.

	The acert plugin evaluates X.509 Attribute Certificates. Group membership
	information encoded as strings can be used to fulfill authorization checks
	defined with the rightgroups ipsec.conf option. Attribute Certificates can be
	loaded locally or get exchanged in IKEv2 certificate payloads.

	The pki command gained support to generate X.509 Attribute Certificates
	using the --acert subcommand, while the --print command supports the ac type.

	The openac utility has been removed in favor of the new pki functionality.

	The libtls TLS 1.2 implementation as used by EAP-(T)TLS and other protocols
	has been extended by AEAD mode support, currently limited to AES-GCM.

	Fixed an issue where CRL/OCSP trustchain validation broke enforcing CA constraints (a844b6589034).

	Limited OCSP signing to specific certificates to improve performance (91d71abb16a9).

	authKeyIdentifier is not added to self-signed certificates anymore (f7d04ba6c462).

	Fixed the comparison of IKE configs if only the cipher suites were different (23f34f6ed504).

	Added a Travis CI config, a test script, and some unit test improvements (e.g. the
	TESTS_SUITES option), see DeveloperDocumentation.
