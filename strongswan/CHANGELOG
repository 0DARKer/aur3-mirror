strongswan-5.0.4
----------------

- Fixed a security vulnerability in the openssl plugin which was reported by
  Kevin Wojtysiak. The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2013-2944.
  Before the fix, if the openssl plugin's ECDSA signature verification was used,
  due to a misinterpretation of the error code returned by the OpenSSL
  ECDSA_verify() function, an empty or zeroed signature was accepted as a
  legitimate one.

- The handling of a couple of other non-security relevant openssl return codes
  was fixed as well.

- The tnc_ifmap plugin now publishes virtual IPv4 and IPv6 addresses via its
  TCG TNC IF-MAP 2.1 interface.

- The charon.initiator_only option causes charon to ignore IKE initiation
  requests.

- The openssl plugin can now use the openssl-fips library.
