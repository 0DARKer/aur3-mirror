2.6.28.7:

pkgrel == 1:

* version bump

2.6.28.6:

pkgrel == 1:

* version bump
* changed last reference to kernel26 to kernel26parallel in kernel26parallel.install

pkgrel == 2:

* fixed md5sums.  again.  yeesh.

pkgrel == 3:

* added a makedepend on 'patch'

2.6.28.5:

pkgrel == 1:

* version bump
* replaced patch-2.6.28.4-1-ARCHparallel with download of -ARCH patch.  there's no benefit in maintaining a separate patch file identical to the Arch-stock patchset.
* replaced explicit references to kernel26parallel with ${pkgname}
* changed _kernver assignment to $(make kernelrelease)
* slightly refined firware-collision-avoidance logic to remove unused directories as well
* added configuration options in build()
* added fix for dvb headers vis-a-vis http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/13146

pkgrel == 2:

* fixed kernel26parallel.install to build parallel initrd (because that's the whole point, innit?)

pkgrel == 3:

* decoupled patchname from pkgrel.

pkgrel == 4:

* fixed md5sum.

2.6.28.4:

pkgrel == 1:

* replaced hard-coded patchfile name with variables
* added logic to remove firmwares that exist in /lib/firmware

2.6.28.8:

pkgrel == 1:

* kernel version bump
* pkgver now takes its base value from _basekernel
* firmware removal code commented out

2.6.29.1:

pkgrel == 1:

* kernel major version bump
* updated depends variables to match new kernel26 PKGBUILD
* actually remove firmwares (whoops!)
