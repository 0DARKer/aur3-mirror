# If Arch distributed this as a binary then building from the Debian sources

# the Arch AUR so it must build any time someone wants it. The progression 
# of Linux soon renders static sources unable to build.

# To build we had to mix the beta INIT and the release or beta ast-base which
# neither the Debian source nor the AT&T downloader is capable of.

# The patches herein are simple clerical errors resulting from a complex build 
# environment failing to support Linux as well as we'd like.

# An advanced PKGBUILD that uses (and abuses) all the features of the AT&T
# build system is the best way to keep up with the ever changing build 
# requirements. It may also attract the attention of the AT&T devs so that
# Linux support improves.

# Gentoo also builds on demand so if you have build problems, check the

# Build Notes.
# This AT&T package builds itself up from the few crude tools supplied in INIT
# and the sources in ast-base. The general progression is
# INIT bin/package -> iffe + mamake + early tools and libs -> nmake
# -> late tools & libs -> ksh -> test
# Each step builds the tools needed to progress to the next step. 

# Their general build technique is to make modified copies of select sources 
# in src to arch. gcc -I- is used to sub in the modified copies. Each 
# target like ksh can use the same src files by making different changes 
# to them then using gcc -I- to sub in the changes. With -I- deprecated
# in 2005 and yet in 2015 it still hasn't been removed gives you an idea of
# how much work it is to fix the build environment to use -iquote, to say
# nothing of the platforms where -I- is still available. Rather than move 
# to -iquote it seems that AT&T et al are just hacking the build so select
# sources compile with or without -I-.

# sed hacking sources in arch/ generally doesn't work because they don't exist
# before the make and they are generated at the time they are used. I had to 
# use chattr +i to lock arch sources to test changes for effectiveness then 
# figure out how to make those changes over in the src files that are 
# available before the build starts and not modified during the build.

# Had I not found ways to do that I'd need to let the make crash, fix the
# file in arch, spirit away the src file so it can't be generated again, 
# then restart the make.

# Hopefully if I document some things future maintainers won't need to spend
# so much time learning the AT&T build system to fix builds.

# The release ast-base will build with the beta INIT. This PKGBUILD can do that
# but you won't be able to trick bin/package into making this combination. 
# From this success I can tell:

# INIT adapts to the ever advancing environments, including Linux.
# ast-base moves forwards as they improve the code.

  # Due to the gcc -I- -iquote problem this appears to include the non
  # prototyped expr.h in src rather than the prototyped version in arch.
  # On Arch Linux it seems to work. The key feature of -I- is that it removes 
  # "." as a search folder from #include "expr.h". The build makes a modified 
  # eval.h in the arch/ folder and uses '-Iarch -I-' to force the arch folder 
  # in front of "." so that one is taken even though there's a eval.h right 
  # next to sources.c. 
  # This key functionality is not at all duplicated by -iquote so fixing the 
  # build hasn't been done. This technique is used so that each target in the 
  # product group ast was extracted from can make custom mods to standard tools 
  # without changing the sources. 
  # The only technique that works reasonably well is to use #include <eval.h> 
  # but that requires changing the sources, something you can't really do on a 
  # multi core build or when the source files are on a network share and many 
  # tool chains are being built at once. Another way is to make a proto eval.h 
  # with an alternate name that is never available but that forces every target 
  # to make custom mods. Smaller targets may not want the extra burden.

  # Once you see how -I- is being used you get an idea of how much damage gcc
  # has done to the large tool chains by deprecating -I-.
