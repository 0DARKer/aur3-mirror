G.729 and G.723.1 codecs x86 (and x86_64) Linux binaries for
Asterisk 1.6.2 Open Source PBX.

DISCLAIMER: You might have to pay royalty fees to the G.729/723.1
            patent holders for using their algorithm.

Binaries

* Choose a codec binary appropriate for your CPU type, use x86_64 for
  64-bit mode. 

* Choose codec versions, use codec_*gcc4*.so for codecs compiled
  with GCC4, or codec_*icc*.so for codecs compiled with Intel ICC.

* Make sure there is only ONE version of the codec. Delete old 
  codec_g729/723*.so files from /usr/lib/asterisk/modules directory

* Copy new codec_g729/723*.so files into /usr/lib/asterisk/modules
  directory.

* Restart Asterisk, if it does not start, it only means that
  the codec version you copied is incompatible with your CPU,
  you should delete it and copy another codec version.

* Check the codec is loaded with 'core show translation recalc 10' on
  Asterisk console.

* G.723.1 send rate is configured in Asterisk codecs.conf file with
  the following.

  [g723]
  ; sendrate=63 #6.3Kbps stream (default) 
  ; sendrate=53 #5.3Kbps
  sendrate=63

* In sip.conf and/or iax.conf, you should explicitly declare the
  use of the codec by adding it globally or under respective peer,
  for example.
  
  disallow=all
  allow=g729
