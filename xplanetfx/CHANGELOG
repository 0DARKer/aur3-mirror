Version 2.2.4:
* Bug in draw_earth() in GUI: resizing simple clouds needs INT values, got FLOAT
  (produced warnings on some systems, errors and dysfunctionality on others,
  if clouds are set to simple style)

Version 2.2.3:
* Stripped postrm file from DEB (in some cases reinstalling removed everything
  related to xplanetFX)

Version 2.2.2:
* Bug in tarfile_installed(): call fill_flipview and fill_themes with themelist
  (Themes downloaded via themepool were displayed only after restart)

Version 2.2.1:
* DEB package broken on fresh install

Version 2.2.0:
* Heavy rewrite of the GUI:
    - Way more consistency between tabs (paddings, sizes, ...)
    - Stripped the view settings from the settings tab and put them to a new one
    - summed all display related options
    - Preview widget now shows more (pseudo) realistic preview of the earth
      (with corona, clouds, specular, post f/x and stars; it's not latest state
      of the art but at least gives a clue about what u are doing)
    - Preview widget got better positioning grid with some values
      (state of the marker button is saved now and it got a new icon)
    - Position widget was pimped with colour, a grid and micro numbering
    - Language went back to settings again
    - Consistent save, refresh and close buttons
    - New function: button to center the earth on the screen
    - Splash screen
    - New application icon
    - stripped theme and style names from thumbview
* Consistent BLURFACTOR depending on screen resolution and earth size
  (all blurs should appear the same in every resolution and with every earth
  size)
* Stars have a nicer corona in h/q mode
* New feature: seamless corona size (old values are recalculated automatically)
* New setting: corona blurriness editable
* New setting: starfield can be zoomed
* Added some more shadows (contrast curve on shadow layer decreased)
* Shadows blur slightly depends on distance of clouds now
* Overall render time decreased about 10% due to the following modifications:
    - Changed overall rendering queue from bottom (background) to top (post)
    - Stars get edited and composed in one step
    - Corona gets rendered on a small square and is blurred, repaged and
      composited in one step
    - Shadows beneath clouds are modified and composited in one step
    - Moon mask gets negated and applied to shadows in one step
* New feature: call a script _before_ the render cycle
* Added orbit setup to CLI --setup interface (oops .)
* Added checks for new values in --setup (backward compat)
* Changed the color of the corona a bit (updates all templates)
* Bug in some templates: set magnify=0 for [moon] in xplanet-clouds
  (moon was rendered in cloud overlay)
* Changed japanese localization name to 日本語
* Changed czech locaisation name to Česky
* Changed french localization name to Français
* Added wrapper functions for drawing contrast icons
* Cleanup in program folder: all icons and images went in subfolders
* Added preinst to clean up icons in program folder
* Added postrm to remove everything related to xplanetFX (except users folder)
* Bug in on_togglebuttonDate_toggled and on_togglebuttonOrbit_toggled:
  they are depending. Either date or orbit.
* Extensive resorting in create_widget_objects and save_config
* no widget writes directly to config, gets collected on save (made problems
  with instant saving of language, autostart and marker state)
* Bug in draw_preview: preview size must always be smaller than canvas size
* Bug in flipview: marker frame didn't respect the alpha part of marker color

Version 2.1.1:
* Added greek language file - thanks to vagrale13!

Version 2.1.0:
* Added new function to render star maps on the background
  (if post f/x enabled, a little glow is added)
* Added python script to generate contrast-enriched star map from original
  bright stars map @ http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?V/50
* Added cleanup: backgrounds folder is cleaned on every theme change
  (saves up to 120 MB disk space)
* Theme change speedup: only neccessary backgrounds and overlays are copied
  (saves some disk space, too)
* Special f/x buttons have icons now (needed space for stars button)
* Little speedup in post f/x: blurring and composing in one step
* Added SEARCHMAPURL to default config file
* Set LOGGING=1 in default config

Version 2.0.22:
* Added dutch language file - thanks to Tim van der Kodde!
* Added czech language file - thanks to Martin Pavlík!

Version 2.0.21:
* Daemon renders to a interim file in the cache first which is copied to the
  final destination afterwards (instead of working on the final image. Looks
  better when xplanetFX got killed while rendering and hopefully ends the bug
  'black wallpaper on first start')
* Names of final images in ./output changed to xplanetFXn.png
* changed default configuration to lon:0, lat:0, showorbit:1, orbit:-60
* Bug in default configuration of GUI: SEARCHMAPURL was missing in dictionary
  _DEFAULT_SETTINGS
* Bug in dameon: render to file failed after cleanup in 2.0.20

Version 2.0.20:
* Bug in orbit function: correction of longitude above/below 180 degrees
  unneccessary (made problems above 180)
* Bug in download_clouds.pl: warning on $MaxRetries

Version 2.0.19:
* Switched the clouds download to test the server list before Coral
* Added version number to GUI title

Version 2.0.18:
* Switched from built-in 'follow sun' to own position correction depending on
  local time (former functions latitude was bound to the suns position) This
  inverts users orbit setting - 0 degrees doesn't look in the sun any more but
  from its direction to the earth (fader feels more natural now, too)
* Implemented Coral network to download_clouds.pl, after 5 tries fallback on
  existing server list

Version 2.0.17:
* Added japanese language file - thanks to bigriver9!
* stripped some echoes from the deamon
* -lat and -log only if no -separate ($ORBIT), -origin removed

Version 2.0.16:
* Changed the no preview thumbnail to fit the flipview
* Added a test on gconftool-2 with fallback to gconftool (Fedora has gconftool-2
  installed as default)
* Added yum and yast to the --setup option
* Let yast and rpm use su instead of sudo
* Added perl-ImageMagick (and similar) to --setup
* Bug in get_pool_thumb: if 0 byte file download again (theme pool list got
  stuck on corrupt image)

Version 2.0.15:
* Added italian language file - thanks to Lino Fantasia!
* Switched position of themepool and execute button (since execute needed a
  bigger landing zone and the themepool is more kind of another theme view
  than a theme action)

Version 2.0.14:
* Set up a better themes server and made xplanetFX fit
* Languages in the combobox are sorted
* Changed translation of orbit label in french language file by Greg Drouin

Version 2.0.13:
* Added french language file - thanks to Greg Drouin!
* Bug in english language pack: 'Warteschlange' wasn't translated

Version 2.0.12:
* Added spanish language file - thanks to ZoSo Moon!
* Re-added the 'search in browser' button to position settings
* Added 'Post f/x active/inactive' to russian language file
* Added perlmagick as a dependency (needed for checking clouds image downloads)
* Added information that a PERL module is missing to verification of clouds
  image (just to be more clear)
* Bug in language files: 's' was missing for cancelled download status

Version 2.0.11:
* Bug in daemon: force updating of clouds and specular layers in every cycle
  independent of what display options are used (clouds and specular layers
  weren't updated properly over the time until a new clouds image got
  downloaded) appeared in ~2.0.4 for the first time when clouds timeout was
  increased

Version 2.0.10:
* Added a russian language file - thanks to Виталий Камелин (Vitaliy Kamelin)!
* Bug in daemon: $SHOWORBIT has to update clouds every render cycle (clouds and
  specular F/X didn't follow the rotation of earth)
* Update in daemon: switched from python to pearl in render cycle (Arch users
  had problems with complicated dependencies situations - thanks to SteveH!)
* Bug in connect_window: bind labelSingle to on_labelSingle_size_allocate
  (wrapping the text correctly on this button failed)
* Bug in the glade file: notebook labels/icons positioning and borders adjusted
* Bug in create_widgets: buttonFit wasn't existent
* Bug in set_labels: buttonFit label wasn't set
* Bug in lang files: no entry for label_fit

Version 2.0.9:
* Content delivery network implemented

Version 2.0.8:
* problems with Sucker class: chunksize for reading socket set to 8192, reading
  is done in a while loop now instead of a for ... in (xplanetFX sometimes
  crashes with segfault while downloading, CPU usage @ 100%) Since the error
  appears unreproducableand rare on my machine I just *hope* it is better now,
  CPU usage dropped to ~30% here
* Bug in destroy(): tempfile.mkstemp() has to prefix xplanetFX_ (the tempfile
  for getting the temp folder was existent after closing the GUI)

Version 2.0.7:
* Automatic language selection - if no language was set by the user gtk gets
  asked first. If its default language is available, it is set temporarily. If
  the first two chars of gtk's language match the first ones of an available
  language in the list and no exact match was found, it is used as a primary
  fallback. Otherwise en is used as the last fallback. Nothing gets saved until
  the user switches the language manually. (hope it works _everywhere_)
* Language selector shows real names (and short locale) instead of just locales
* xplanetFX version is printed in the title of a render cycle log
* Bug in xplanetFX render cycle: random lat/lon has to update clouds images
  every render cycle (clouds were rendered once every 3 hours and didn't move)

Version 2.0.6:
* Bug in default configuration: switched from de to en as default language
* Bug with cancel download button: hiding in glade caused wrong colour (seems
  to be a bug in GTK - hidden objects don't know their background color when
  shown later); workaround: show in glade and hide later in the code
* Bug in glade file: unequal positioning of icons and labels in update wizard
  under different themes
* Bug in lang_en: confirm window translations for log deletion missing (unused)
  
Version 2.0.5:
* flipview with alpha instead of a blinder above every image
* flipview with custom background color
* flipview with round sizing/positioning (not appearing so linear in line)
* Bug in on_buttonUpdateTemplates_clicked: changed new->updates and new->nots
  (all numeral amounts showed the value of new available templates)
* Bug in select_view and scroll_view: switched from if to try/except
  (click on first item in flipview didn't switch thumbview and themeview)

Version 2.0.4:
* Bug in --geometry and install_template: added repositioning of earth depending
  on ratio setting (The fucking ugliest bug finally got fixed: position of earth
  on different display ratios)

Version 2.0.3:
* Update dialog pimped with icons, big buttons and better language support
* Added changelog to the website
* Bug in pool_theme_ready: conditional installing if file exists (untar crashed
  if file isn't available - should be fixed with sucker, too)
* Bug in sucker: _CB_READY got called on _CB_CANCEL also (download crashed on
  cancel while trying to move the deleted file in _READY_CB)
* Bug in save_config: if resolution changes new pixbufs for preview have to be
  generated (preview was distorted after ratio change)
* Bug in draw_preview: size of earth is calculated only by height not by ratio
  of the screen size (preview did it wrong and resized the earth) thanks to hari
  
Version 2.0.2:
* Detailed clouds log
* Clouds image verification
* Usage of default clouds if a download failed
* Localized times in log
* Bug in tarfile_installed: no pollist available if not connected before untar
* Stop image color wrong (changed in image files)
* Suns glare disabled in xplanetFX process (finally!)
* All objects and naming disabled in configs (f.i.n.a.l.l.y!)

Version 2.0.1:
* Bugfix in the update wizard in on_buttonUpdateTemplates_clicked()
    (updates were a list of names not template objects, auto updating failed)
* Bugfix in the Sucker class in run() with calling back pool_thumb_ready()
    (callback wasn't called when the file had to be copied to a destination,
    refresh of list while loading thumbs didn't work)

Version 2.0.0:
* Fetch themes directly from server, features include:
    - cached thumbnails
    - update notification
    - custom iconview (theme based)
    - download queue
    - cancel downloads
    - cleanup downloads even if app is closed
    - multiple selection for removing/downloading
* update-wizard for themes from the pool
* Positioning of the view with new graphical widget
* Blinding of settings widgets with gtk color
* single logfile with autosize
* every expensive action swapped to threads, so GUI doesn't stop responding any
  more and status is working
* Massive cleanup in GUI
* icons with automatic contrast selection
* some commenting in the source
* source style comes closer to PEP8
