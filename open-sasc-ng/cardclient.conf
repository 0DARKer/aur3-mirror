# Sample protocols for use in Linux PC x86 systems
#
# Comment lines can start with # or ;
#
# every client line starts with the client name, followed by some arguments:
# 'hostname' The name of the server
#	     Use "localhost" if card server is on the same machine
# 'port'     The port number as defined by the card server
#            This is set on the card server usually between 10000 and 50000
# 'emm'      The flag to allow EMM transfers to the server
#            (0=disabled 1=enabled) This should always be set to 1!
# 'caid'     (optional) caid on which this client should work.
#            Best is allow to autodetect
# 'mask'     (optional) mask for caid. E.g. caid=1700 mask=FF00 would allow
#            anything between 1700 & 17FF. Default is 1700 & FF00.
#            If only the caid is specified, the mask value will be set to FFFF
#            You may give multiple caid/mask values comma separated
#            (e.g. 1702,1722,0d0c/ff00).
#            Best is allow to autodetect
# 'username' is the login username
# 'password' is the login password
#
# radegast client
# Radegast doesn't autodetect the CAID and MASK values and must be specified
#radegast:hostname:port:0/0B00/FFFF
#
# camd33 client (tcp protocol)
# for autodetect of CAID and MASK with camd33 specify "0000"
#camd33:hostname:port:1/0000/0000:username:password
# 
# camd35 client (udp protocol)
# for autodetect of CAID and MASK with camd35 specify "0000"
#camd35:hostname:port:1/0000/0000:username:password
#
# newcamd client
# 'cfgkey' is a required 28byte config key that can be anything
# for autodetect of CAID and MASK with newcamd, you leave the fields omitted
#newcamd:hostname:port:1:username:password:0102030405060708091011121314
