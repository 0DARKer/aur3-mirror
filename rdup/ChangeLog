	* rdup 1.0.0-1:
	Added Changelog.
	Some fixes (added -lgmp) for compiling with the new gcc (4.4.0) with
		libnettle present.

	* rdup 1.0.2-1:
	Fixes for gcc-4.4.* not needed anymore.
	We now depend on (lib)nettle mandatorily.

	* rdup 1.0.3-1:
	Temporary sed fixup for signed/unsigned warning (=> error).

	* rdup 1.0.4-1:
	Sed fix not needed anymore.
	Nettle is still a hard depends (although the author claims it's
	optional); ./configure detects that libnettle is not present, but
	compilation still tries to use hash algos from it.

	* rdup 1.1.0-1 to 1.1.11-1:
	Just regular updates.

	* rdup 1.1.11-2:
	-Werror causes problems once more, but this time it's enough to
	remove a couple of things from rdup.c - so I made a patch for it.

	* rdup 1.1.12-1:
	Removed the patch (see above).

	* rdup 1.1.13-1:
	-Werror again.

	* rdup 1.1.13-2:
	fixed building properly (from rdup's git repo,
	thanks Andreas Baumann)

	* rdup 1.1.14-1:
	Updated to a new version. Removed build patch.
