Make sure you include /etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-carddavmate.conf to your /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf by appending the line to httpd.conf at the the end of the file as follows:

Include conf/extra/httpd-carddavmate.conf

Also, edit the httpd-carddavmate.conf file before activating it, see file contents for explanation.

Then, restart apache:

sudo rc.d restart httpd

the login/password is test/test, to change this, edit the /srv/httpd/carddavmate/htpasswd file (see man htpasswd).

open the index.html using Safari, Webkit or Chrome (only these browsers allow cross domain queries from local source)
if everythink works upload the CardDavMATE to your server
if the CardDavMATE is installed on the same domain as your CardDav software, the setup is complete
if the CardDavMATE is NOT installed on the same domain as your CardDav software, you need to update your web server configuration (on the domain where your CardDav software is installed) according to config.txt and set proper value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin (the origin of the domain where the CardDavMATE is installed).
do not forget to set up password(s) using .htaccess to disallow public access to your installation
done ;)
