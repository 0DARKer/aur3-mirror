Subject: [PATCH 4/4] Input: synaptics - Remove X1 Carbon 3rd gen from the
 topbuttonpad list

Lenovo decided to switch back to physical buttons for the trackstick
on their latest series. The PNPId list was provided before they reverted
back to physical buttons, so it contains the new models too.
We can know from the touchpad capabilities that the touchpad has physical
buttons, so removing the ids from the list is not mandatory. It is still
nicer to remove the wrong ids, so start by removing the X1 Carbon 3rd gen,
with the PNPId of LEN0048.
