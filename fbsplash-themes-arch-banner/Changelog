        Fix the small start/stop icons
0.6     Added a icons configuration file
        Find and link icons into a tmp dir at runtime
0.7     Some cleaning of the code and texts
0.8     Minor fix in rc_init-pre
0.9     Avoid fbcondecor complaining about missing icons: recreate the cached symlinks
1.0     Improve shutdown behavior:

        Use fixed separator images instead of drawing boxes and parts of image
1.0.1   Clean red separator on exit (for tuxoniceui_fbsplash)
1.1     Avoid tuxoniceui_fbsplash showing allways a reverse progress
1.2     Added a simple animation to the progress bar background for bootup (mainly because of fsck)
1.2.1   Made the animation look a little bit nicer
1.2.2   Don't use /usr/bin/dirname - might not exist if /usr lives on a separate FS
1.2.3   Drop the mysqld icon because it is missing in Tango and gnome
1.2.4   Just fixed some of the files headers
1.2.5   Create icon symlinks required by broken fbcondecor_ctl already on installation
        Drop rc_exit-post (might have readonly root FS)
        Repeat creating icon symlinks and reload theme on rc_init boot (might have separate /usr FS)
1.2.6   Drop reload at rc_init boot stuff - splash restart should be done by the splash framework
1.2.7   Fix broken shutdown icons

        Use splash_svc_failed from initscripts-extras-fbsplash>=97
1.2.9   Fix red separator line not used when starting in multi-user mode with failure from sysinit
1.2.10  Drop splash_svclist_init calls - should be done by the splash framework
1.3     Allow using icons for random daemons
        Use blend effects for daemons icons
1.3.1   Wait for blendout before splash daemon kill on shutdown
1.3.2   Avoid blinking on splash daemon restart on shutdown
1.3.3   Added a short one second blendin for the progress bar and made the icon blends short to
1.4     Automatic services/daemons-icon positioning
        Support initscripts services
        Drop icon blending - doesn't really work on slow machines without adding much extra sleep
        Just shade icons while starting/stopping daemons
1.4.1   Some speedup changes for icons theme:
        * Improved icon position lookup
        * Support service hooks sourcing
        * Eliminate functions.sh
