2012-10-22 Jason St. John <jstjohn .. purdue . edu>

	* 3.8.0-1:
	New upstream release (3.8.0).
	As of this release, this package will be updated to both the stable and
	   unstable versions of OpenNebula. It seemed foolish to require users to
	   regularly switch packages if they always wanted to be on the latest
	   version. In short, this package will be updated more frequently than
	   the stable 'opennebula' package.
	Two harmless possible error messages when building the package are now
		sent to /dev/null.

	Removed message in opennebula-unstable.install regarding the
	   aforementioned patch.
