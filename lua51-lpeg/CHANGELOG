	* 0.12-4 :
	Now package download and compilation using luarocks are on a separate 
	build() section, instead of being included in the package() section.

	Removed compatibility with luarocks.
	It was a bad idea overall, it's better to do what official packages do:
	ignore luarocks and assume it's not to be used in conjunction with
	pacman packages.

	Reformatted CHANGELOG.

	* 0.12-3 :
	Moved package luarocks from depends array to makedepends

	* 0.12-2 :
	Now uses luarocks to install the package.
	This was necessary to allow us better support for others lua packages
	(ex: moonscript) and packages installed at the system level with
	luarocks.
	This will blow up if we try to remove the package using luarocks itself,
	but i don't believe there is a way around that.
