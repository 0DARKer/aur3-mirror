    * 0.12-2 :
    - Now uses luarocks to install the package.
      This was necessary to allow us better support for others lua packages
      (ex: moonscript) and packages installed at the system level with 
      luarocks.
      This will blow up if we try to remove the package using luarocks itself,
      but i don't believe there is a way around that.
