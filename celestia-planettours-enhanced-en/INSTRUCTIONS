In /usr/share/celestia/data/solarsys.scc find where it says "Earth" "Sol", make the Texture to "Earth2k.jpg" and make the NightTexture "EarthNight2k.jpg". Farther down in "Earth" "Sol" there will be an option for CloudMap. Change this to "EarthClouds.png". Next, under "Moon" "Sol/Earth" change the texture to "Moon2k.jpg". Now under "Mars" "Sol" go to the Atmosphere section and add the lines 'CloudHeight 10', 'CloudSpeed 70' and 'CloudMap "MarsClouds.png"'. For Jupiter, you want to add a new section that looks like the following:

Rings {
	Inner 92000
	Outer 221000
	Texture "JupiterRings.png"
}

Next in "Saturn" "Sol" make the texture "Saturn.jpg" with a capital S.  For "Mimas" "Sol/Saturn" make the texture "Mimasc.jpg" and for "Tethys" "Sol/Saturn" make the texture "Tethysc.jpg". You must also add a Rings secion for Saturn and it looks like this:

Rings {
	Inner 74660
	Outer 140220
	Texture "SaturnRings.png"
	Color  [ 1.0 0.88 0.82 ]
}

It might also help to add the Color setting to all planets with rings. For Neptune, change the texture to "neptune-correct.jpg". That's it, everything from the Tours should work. I know most of you would have preferred a patch file to do this automatically but I'm sure that would cause problems for people with Celestia plugins and alternate textures already. If you have a scipted solution that is intelligent enough to cope with varrying modified solarsys.scc files, send it to connor.behan@gmail.com, I'd love to see it!
