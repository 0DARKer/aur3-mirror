| 
|     Beatmap downloader improvements and fixes.
|     Updates:
|     - Added some buttons to downloads menu: clear inactive downloads, import beatmaps, reset search, and show/hide unranked maps.
|     - Small changes to OsuParser, OszUnpacker, and OsuGroupList (mostly adding return values) to allow parsing only newly unpacked beatmaps.
|     - Added alpha fade hover effect to MenuButton, as an alternative to expanding (used for 3-part menu buttons).
|     - Added text rendering fields to MenuButton (also for the 3-part menu buttons).
|     - Added sound effects to downloads menu.
|     
|     Fixes:
|     - Check downloads for illegal filename characters, and remove them if necessary.
|     - The number of results and downloads shown now supports all resolutions.
|     - Confirmation dialog no longer appears when restarting the application (since downloads are static).
|     - Do not set a focus node immediately if the theme song will be played.
|     - Always play the theme song if no songs are loaded (even if disabled in settings).

| 
|     Implemented an internal beatmap downloader (using Bloodcat).
|     The downloads menu can be accessed through the button on the right side of the main menu.  The downloader supports searching and concurrent downloads (NOTE: this is limited by the download server!).  Double-click any search result to begin downloading it to the SongPacks directory; cancel the download by hitting the red 'x' in the upper-right corner.  A confirmation will appear if trying to quit opsu! while downloads are running.
|     
|     New classes:
|     - Download: represents an individual download from a remote address to a local path, and provides status and progress information; downloads files using Java NIO.
|     - DownloadNode: holds a Download object as well as additional beatmap fields, and handles drawing.
|     - DownloadList: manages the current list of downloads.
|     - DownloadsMenu: game state controller.
|     - DownloadServer: interface for a beatmap download server.
|     - BloodcatServer: implements DownloadServer using Bloodcat.
|     - ReadableByteChannelWrapper: wrapper for ReadableByteChannel that tracks progress.
|     
|     Added images:
|     - "downloads" image by @kouyang.
|     - "search-background" image from "Minimalist Miku" skin (listed in credits).
|     - "delete" icon by Visual Pharm (https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/27842/) under CC BY-ND 3.0.
|     
|     Other changes:
|     - Added up/down/left/right Expand directions to MenuButton class.
|     - Removed width/height parameters from OsuParser (leftovers).
