This version contains important fixes and enhancements for existing features, along with significant internal updates. Once again, thank you for all the helpful bug reports and pull requests!
Updates:

    Added a beatmap cache database to drastically improve load times.
    Moved lots of loading to directly before starting a game (e.g. images, timing points, combo colors, breaks). This also improves load times.
    Added an automatic updater for new releases.
    Multiple instances of sound clips can now be played simultaneously. (#25)
    Implemented addition and edge addition hit sounds. (#27)
    Added bar notifications for many events.
    Auto-fill error forms with all available information.
    Write build information to a "version" file when building.
    Implemented "relax" mod.
    Added a "pop" effect to the combo counter.

Bug fixes:

    Major spinner fixes: fade in effect, support counterclockwise rotation, show RPM for "auto"/"spun-out" mods, remove dependence on FPS. (#37)
    Fixed some uncommon issues with slider calculations. (#26, #39)
    Correct actions are now taken at the end of tracks (e.g. next song in the main menu, loop to preview time in the song menu). (#38)
    Support loading case-insensitive audio files names and some incorrectly named files.
    Fixed issue where JarSplice wasn't copying anything in the META-INF directory.

Input-related changes:

    Added an "input" category to the options menu.
    Added options to disable the mouse wheel or mouse buttons.
    Clicking the mouse wheel during gameplay now pauses the game.
    Removed left/right game key restrictions. (#31)

            F7: cycles through FPS settings
            F10: toggles mouse enable/disable state during gameplay
        Main menu:
            d: opens downloads menu
            r: plays random track
