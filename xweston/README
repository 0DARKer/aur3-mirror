Xweston - Run rooted Xwayland in Weston

This package allows to run Xwayland as an ordinary X server (i.e. taking
over the root window) hosted by Weston.
This should enable one to use an X window manager instead of the one
included with Weston.
Like Weston, Xweston can be started from within an existing X session, another
Wayland session or on bare hardware, i.e. a free VT.

Note: this is VERY experimental, there are known issues.


Configuration

Create ${HOME}/.config/weston.ini with the following contents:

[shell]
client=/usr/bin/Xwayland-wrapper


Usage

Start the server using a command like the following:

$ startx -- /usr/bin/Xweston

To pass extra commandline options to Weston, set variable WESTON_OPTS,
for example:

$ WESTON_OPTS=--fullscreen startx -- /usr/bin/Xweston
