Xweston - Run rooted Xwayland in Weston

This package allows to run Xwayland as an bare X server (i.e. taking
over the root window) hosted by Weston.
This should enable one to use an X window manager instead of the one
included with Weston.
Like Weston, Xweston can be started from within an existing X session, another
Wayland session or on bare hardware, i.e. a free VT.

Note: this is still experimental, there are known issues.

Usage

Xweston can be started like any ordinary X server.

Some examples

- Using startx, also works from within a running X session:

$ startx -- /usr/bin/Xweston

- Using startx from within a running X session,
  passing extra commandline options to weston:

$ WESTON_OPTS=--fullscreen startx -- /usr/bin/Xweston

- Addong a dynamic seat from within a running LightDM session:

# dm-tool add-seat xlocal xserver-command=/usr/bin/Xweston
