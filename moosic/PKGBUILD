# README.txt: moosic claims to work with Python 2.2 or later but seems to fail with 2.6 or later
#   Currently (2011-03-10) AUR contains python 2.4 (python24)
#   but neither the Arch Linux package database nor AUR contains python 2.2
# README.txt: moosic calls `find' (searching the source for popen shows only 'find ...' used)
depends=('python24' 'findutils')
# moosic can control almost any media player program
# and is not actually limited to audio formats
# The optdepends list would be too long if comprehensive,
# so I've included only the programs in the default config file
