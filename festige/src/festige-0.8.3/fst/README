Whats This ?
------------

This is a linux vst host. Runs as a jack client.
Uses jack midi input.
Only works for GUI plugins currently.

Supports Ladish.

Getting Started
---------------

1) ensure you have the necessary build dependencies:

   gtk-devel
   jack-devel

2) Type 'make'. If everything works correctly this should create an
   executable file called 'fst'.

3) To run your vst plugins:

   ./fst /path/to/ladish/filename /path/to/someplugin.dll

   and set up the inputs and outputs, eg. using qjackctl's
   'Connections' window.

   The Ladish file name may not exist.
   But, if it does, it will load it's state.

4) To install copy both fst and fst.exe.so into your $PATH
   (i think they need to be in the same folder)


Stuff
-----

There is a first version of midi learn, load/save of midimap
will come tomorrow. i had my beer now and its 5:15
i should be in a club. but i go to bed now.
just press midi learn, move a plugin control and your midi
control.

This thing is the best vst soft, as it interprets transport info
correctly.
