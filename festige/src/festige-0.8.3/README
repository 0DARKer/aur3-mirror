FeSTige is a GUI for fst and dssi-vst,
allowing you to run Windows VST plugins on Linux.

FeSTige is currently being developed by falkTX
and it's released under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or superior.
(see the 'COPYRIGHT' file for details)


----- COMPILE:
In order to use FeSTige, you first have to compile it.
You'll need the dev packages of:
  - Python
  - PyQt4
  - Qt4
  - Wine
  - Gtk

Run "make" to compile the code.
Then run "[sudo] make install" to install it.




----- USAGE:
Use the menu "Edit" -> "Preferences" to tune it to your needs.
Select a plugin from the list and click "Launch",
Or open a specific plugin using the menu "File" -> "Open".




----- NOTES:
vsthost (from 'dssi-vst') doesn't not support recursive search.
FeSTige will "env VST_PATH" to the folder containg the plugin, then
run 'vsthost'. This fixes the issue of not founding the plugin.

In the FeSTige source code, 'patches' folder, you can find the patch
to enable realtime scheduling in Wine and ladish support in fst.

I hope you enjoy FeSTige!
