TODO:
 - Did I miss something..?

NOTES:
 - To make sure the GUI didn't get locked when requesting a plugin info, this action will
   trigger a new thread on FeSTige, so you'll notice a delay from the time you pressed "Info"
   until the MessageBox appears.
   It has to be this way or else a plugin could eventually cause FeSTige to stop working.


------ version 0.4.1: --------

CHANGES:
 - Fixed crash on new installs


------ version 0.4: --------

CHANGES:
 - Added a custom 'fst' with Ladish support
 - Install custom 'fst' in PATH
 - Updated code to handle new 'fst'
 - Properly close Jack when closing FeSTige
 - Removed 'python-central' dependency, which seems to be
   a Debian specific thing

TODO:
 - Get information from plugins
 - Launch plugin when double-clicking it on the list
 - Implement a way of sorting the plugins
 - Add the plugin to the ladish studio instead of just run it
 - Make the final cmd line editable

NOTES:
 - The ladish patch for fst can be found on the "outro" directory.
 - FeSTige now needs the custom "fst.exe" and "fst.exe.so" to
   be installed in PATH. Make sure you run 'make' and 'make install'


------ version 0.3: --------

CHANGES:
 - Removed KDE dependencies (which causes:)
    -> Window attributes (position, etc) will not be saved/restored
    -> Icon theme restriced to Oxygen
 - Added support for 'dssi-vst'
 - Added option for WINEPREFIX variable
 - Added option for WINERT variable
 - Added option for 'chrt'
 - Added option for additional command-line arguments
 - Show final command used to launch the plugin
 - Show all midi outputs properly (for 'fst' auto-connect)
 - Show a context menu when right-clicking the plugin list
 - When selecting a plugin, change the status bar message it's full path

TODO:
 - Get information from plugins
 - Launch plugin when double-clicking it on the list
 - Implement a way of sorting the plugins

NOTES:
 - 'dssi-vst' doesn't not support recursive search.
   FeSTige will "export VST_PATH" to the folder containg the plugin, then
   runs 'vsthost' (the 'dssi-vst' wrapper). This fixes the issue.
 - In the FeSTige source code you can find the patch for enable realtime
   scheduling in Wine. This is useful to get less xruns on small buffer sizes.
 - There is so many changes in this release that I decided to skip one version number.
   I hope you enjoy FeSTige!
