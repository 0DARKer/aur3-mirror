# ChaiScript is a scripting language that easily embeds into your existing C++ applications. 
# It's built to be flexible and dynamic, yet still maintain the type-safety you expect as a C++ user. 
# It can natively use classes, methods, and attributes, even if the class inherits functionality 
# from a parent class.
# It was created by Jason and Jonathan Turner

# As of 2.0, it also supports exceptions and automatic thread-safety.
