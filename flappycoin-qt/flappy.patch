-Development process
--------------------
-
-Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
-their feature or bug fix is ready.
-
-If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Flappycoin
-development team members simply pulls it.
-
-If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
-submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
-[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).
-
-The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
-Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
-match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
-controversial.
-
-The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
-completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
-regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Flappycoin.
-
-Testing
--------
-
-Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
-requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
-remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
-lots of money.
-
-### Automated Testing
-
-Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
-submit new unit tests for old code.
-
-Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:
-
-    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test
-
-Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:
-
-    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
-    make -f Makefile.test
-    ./flappycoin-qt_test
