Wargus is a Warcraft2 Mod that allows you to play Warcraft2 with the Stratagus engine, as opposed to play it with the original Warcraft2 one.

!!IMPORTANT You must have Warcraft 2 CD (or CD iso) mounted at /mnt/cdrom if you want this script to work (ie. mount -o loop warII.iso /mnt/cdrom/)

Tested with Warcraft II: Beyond the dark portal, should work with Warcraft II: Tides of darkness as well. BATTLE.NET edition is not supported!

To run the game, just install pkg and type 'wargus'


If you want to have original music (hint form http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=645845)
>>find warcraft2 OST or rip music from original CD
>>add all the music into one file with audacity, nero wave editor or any decent sound editor
>>save as 8 bit mono PCM wave file 44100 samplerate
>>add to *.gz archive using archive manager or other software
>>rename archive to 'default.mod.gz'
>>replace default.mod.gz in stratagus/data/music/ folder with the one just made

ENjoy!
