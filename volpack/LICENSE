8. Credits
----------

VolPack was written by Phil Lacroute at the Computer Graphics
Laboratory, Stanford University.  The algorithms are based on Phil's
Ph.D. thesis research and are described in the following paper:
Philippe Lacroute and Marc Levoy, Fast Volume Rendering Using a
Shear-Warp Factorization of the Viewing Transformation, Proc. SIGGRAPH
'94 (Orlando, Florida, July 24-29, 1994).  In Computer Graphics
Proceedings, Annual Conference Series, 1994, ACM SIGGRAPH, pp. 451-458.

If you publish a rendering made using VolPack and you would like to
make an attribution, the following form is suggested:

    Image generated using the Stanford VolPack volume renderer.

An appropriate longer attribution could omit the word Stanford but would
include a citation of the SIGGRAPH '94 paper:

    Image generated using the VolPack volume renderer [#].
