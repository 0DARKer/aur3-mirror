#Begin orderings

# NOTE that PORD is distributed within MUMPS by default. If you would like to
# use other orderings, you need to obtain the corresponding package and modify
# the variables below accordingly.
# For example, to have Metis available within MUMPS:
#          1/ download Metis and compile it
#          2/ uncomment (suppress # in first column) lines
#             starting with LMETISDIR,  LMETIS
#          3/ add -Dmetis in line ORDERINGSF
#             ORDERINGSF  = -Dpord -Dmetis
#          4/ Compile and install MUMPS
#             make clean; make   (to clean up previous installation)
#
#          Metis/ParMetis and SCOTCH/PT-SCOTCH (ver 5.1 and later) orderings are now available for MUMPS.
#

# You have to choose one among the following two lines depending on
# the type of analysis you want to perform. If you want to perform only
# sequential analysis choose the first (remember to add -Dscotch in the ORDERINGSF
# variable below); for both parallel and sequential analysis choose the second
# line (remember to add -Dptscotch in the ORDERINGSF variable below)
