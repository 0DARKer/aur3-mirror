# Driver support for Kodak ESP printers is nearly matured,
# however HERO printers support is still in its early stages.

# There is no scanner support, yet.

# Try building and installing the cups-usblp PKGBUILD from
# the AUR if you have problems with CUPS detecting the
# printer via a USB connection.

# I had to do this to use my Kodak printer on Arch Linux.
