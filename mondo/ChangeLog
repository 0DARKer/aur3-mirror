	* [r2011] Fix warnings and errors in previous libmondo-cli.c patch

2008-08-10  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r2007] Patch and comment from Michael Shapiro:
	  
	  I wrote a function called get_dsf_mount_list() that, given a
	  whole disk device special file (dsf), it will return a list of
	  all of the mounted file systems residing on that disk in the
	  variable included_dsf_list, and a list of all of the mounted file
	  systems that are not residing on that disk in the variable
	  excluded_dsf_list:
	  
	  static int
	  get_dsf_mount_list (char *dsf,
	  char **included_dsf_list,
	  char **excluded_dsf_list);
	  
	  The function does the following:
	  
	  - Verifies that the dsf exists and has a partition table on it.
	  
	  - Creates a linked list of all of the locally mounted file
	  systems (i.e. the mount points that start with "/dev/") using a
	  new structure called mounted_fs_struct. Each structure contains
	  the name of the
	  device, the device's mount point, and a variable called check
	  that will be set to 1 if the mount point resides on the disk and
	  a 0 if the mount point does not reside on the disk.
	  
	  - Loops through each partition on the disk and:
	  
	  -- If the partition is swap, it ignores it.
	  
	  -- If the partition is mounted (e.g. /dev/sda1 is mounted on
	  /boot, /dev/sda2 is mounted on /usr, etc.), it finds its entry on
	  the linked list and sets check == 1.
	  
	  -- If the partition is part of a Volume Group that has Logical
	  Volumes mounted, it finds its entry on the linked list for each
	  mounted Logical Volume in that Volume Group and sets check == 1.
	  Note that if
	  the Volume Group contains more than one disk, it will still add
	  the entry even if the Logical Volume's extents are not on, or
	  only partially on, the dsf that was passed in to the function.
	  For example,
	  Volume Group VolGroup00 contains the disks /dev/sda1 and
	  /dev/sdb1, and the Logical Volumes LogVol01, which is mounted on
	  /var and has all of its extents on /dev/sda1, and LogVol02, which
	  is mounted as /usr
	  and has all of its extents on /dev/sdb1. If you pass /dev/sda

	  that VMWare support won't be possible anytime soon)

	  correctly for udev. Not very elegant, but should solve our
	  current issues

	* [r1755] Fix UUID support which was still broken.
	  Caveat: It can't work for swap partitions as there is no mksap -U
	  option contrary to the -L option for LABEL
	  So at reboot you won't have swap activated and you'll have to run
	  vol_id -u the_swap_partition to fix your /etc/fstab file

	  Use mr_stresc() to properly escape strings submitted to system()
	  in
	  gen_aux_list(). (Also fixes Debian bug #379966.)
	* [r841] Fixed display problem in newt mode where old strings
	  weren't fully
	  overwritten which led to garbled display by improving function
	  center_string(). (This is also the fix for Debian bug #320152.)

2006-09-25  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r831] Add new header mr_string.h for mr_string.c. Use
	  mr_strtok() from
	  mr_string.c and delete from libmondo-string.c. Add mr_string.c
	  and
	  mr_string.h to Makefile.am. (Follow-up to r828.)

2006-09-24  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r828] Add new file with new generation string handling
	  functions.
	  (File is currently not used yet.)
	* [r827] Check for grub.conf being a symbolic link which is the
	  case on e.g.
	  Debian and resolve accordingly in stabgrub-me to avoid GRUB
	  installation
	  error if mountlist was changed. Requires readlink which should be
	  in our
	  included busybox as of revision 822
	  [http://www.mondorescue.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/changeset/822].

2006-09-23  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r825] - mindi-busybox added to build process scripts
	  - RPM spec file updated with realistic content
	  - mondo spec file adapted with fedora feedback
	  (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=187318)

2006-09-23  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r820] AFS support tweaking:
	  - don't scan fstab for AFS - AFS volumes don't appear in fstab;
	  - don't exclude AFS volumes per se in open_and_list_dir(), rather
	  don't
	  scan any directories that have been excluded - can generally
	  improve
	  scan times if '-N' or '-E' is used, i.e. not AFS specific (but
	  required for AFS!).
	* [r818] Enhance the way we deal with post-nuke:
	  - ask whether post-nuke should be executed if it exists even if
	  we are
	  not in nuke mode;
	  - log the fact that no post-nuke script was found during restore;
	  - perform after nuke steps even if we dropped back to interacive
	  mode
	  because of issue with mount list;
	  - ask user after nuke to wait until s/he is returned to command
	  prompt
	  before rebooting;
	  - use run_program_and_log_output() instead of system() to get
	  output of
	  post-nuke logged;
	  - output screen messages about post-nuke.
	* [r816] Evaluate errno after popen in space_occupied_by_cd() and
	  in case of an
	  error create a log entry and return 0 as size.

2006-09-23  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r814] removed useless tcurr now
	* [r813] Takes Andree's idea to create rather a mr_date() function,
	  that could be put in a lib file later on if we need it elsewhere
	  (first candidate would be mondorestore :-)
	* [r812] Fix a bug whete /tmp was hardcoded for ntfsclone usage,
	  creating a problem for an attempt to use mondo with a live CD.
	  (reported by Dale Tronrud <det102_at_uoxray.uoregon.edu>)

2006-09-23  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r811] Added an icon for use in menus etc.
	* [r810] Fix new time stamp log feature:
	  - use ctime() which gives human-readable time output rather than
	  get_time() which gives seconds since epoch (also fixes
	  segmentation
	  fault caused by get_date() returning long and out being %s);
	  - unlink the log _before_ start time is written to it so we don't
	  lose it
	  - call it 'time' rather than 'date' plus some cosmetics
	* [r809] Turn assignment into comparison when evaluating the paths
	  to exclude.

2006-09-22  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r807] Fix a bug in Debian build system for mindi (variables
	  needs to be system like not build env like) (reported by Martin
	  A. Brooks <mbrooks_at_fotango.com>)
	* [r806] Attempt to Fix #33
	* [r805] Atempt to fix bug #14
	* [r804] Attempt to fix #6
	* [r802] Attempt to fix bug #25

2006-09-21  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r801] Should fix bug #21 by exporting variables from start-nfs
	  and overriding values in mondo-rstr-tools.c with thee exports
	* [r799] Replace a useless message by a more useful

2006-09-16  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r797] newt-specific.c:
	  Fixed compile error by removing superfluous quotes in
	  kill_anything_like_this().
	  
	  libmondo-fork.c:
	  Fixed compiler warning on 64bit platforms regarding the output of
	  the
	  result of ftello() by casting it to long long (and it's actually
	  signed).
	  
	  libmondo-fifo.c:
	  Added %s for ps_options in kill_buffer(). Also fixes compiler
	  warning.

2006-09-13  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r792] Fix Bug #24
	  - Introduce kill_anything_like_this as a function instead of
	  define
	  - Add an external variable ps_options whose value is empty in
	  restore and auxww in archive
	* [r787] AFS support added

2006-09-03  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r785] Trac is now accessible with the simpler URL
	  http://trac.mondorescue.org

2006-08-12  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r781] - Gentoo build now correct
	  - 4 articles kept on frontpage
	  - New announces made
	  - Build process optimized agin and again :-)

2006-08-08  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r770] gentoo build improvements

2006-08-07  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r763] - Remove Berlios references where obsolete
	  - Improve mindi patch for LVM on Debian
	  - bzip2 now created during svn2build, and used later by othe
	  scripts (rationale: done once and used now a lot)
	  - Fix a patch for mkannounce
	* [r761] - spec file should not use TAG for Source file name
	  anymore
	  - Fix a URL problem for gentoo packages
	  - Fix autorun installation and mode (bug found by SuSE)

2006-08-06  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r755] - Use _defaultdocdir instead of RPM_DOC_DIR for doc built
	  - %doc in spec files reviewed
	  - Log file for all build scripts
	  - Fix a bug for ebuild
	  - src file is now name-verion.tar.gz (without TAG)
	  - deb pkgs should now be copied on ftp server
	  - Fix 2 warnings in mondo
	  - Fix a bug introduced for LVM on Debian hopefully
	  - Fix a bug on old distros where mktemp needs a template

2006-08-05  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r746] - Still trying to fix LABEL + LVM in mindi
	  - Removed some X11 files remaining
	  - remove some ps options not available with busybox
	  - Use LOGFILE constantly in init & LogIt

2006-08-04  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r744] With that version mindi --makemountlist works for RHEL4 +
	  LVMv2 + LABEL
	* [r743] The latest interface modification on start-nfs imply that
	  mondo >= 2.0.9 requires now mindi >= 1.0.9

2006-08-03  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r738] Fixed compiler warnings on amd64 (and likely 64bit in
	  general):
	  - "cast to pointer from integer of different size" by making
	  relevant
	  variables long rather than int which gives 32bit on i386 and
	  64bit on
	  amd64;
	  - "cast from pointer to integer of different size" by casting to
	  long
	  rather than int for same reasons.

2006-08-03  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r737] Big NFS+PXE migration: start-nfs is not created by
	  mondoarchive, but on the fly by init during restore. This allows
	  more flexibility to restore through NFS a backup created on disks
	  e.g. and simplify code.

2006-07-31  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r732] - More tests on gentoo packaging. Still not there but much
	  better
	  - Fix a pb on debian mondo-doc

	* [r724] Also using bzip2 for SuSE based RPMS (Lars proposal)
	* [r723] Build RPMS modified again for TAG

2006-07-28  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r722] Remove TAG also from SPEC files
	* [r719] Re-introduce defattr to have correct uid/gid for RPMS
	  (Bishop.Clark_at_gov.bc.ca)

2006-07-25  bcornec

	* [r716] Review of obsoletes and provides following discussion on
	  cooker.
	  For Mandriva and Debian will make 2.0x waiting for 3.0.0

2006-07-23  bcornec

	* [r714] Guess what ;-)
	* [r713] autorun again
	* [r712] autorun always
	* [r711] Still on autorun
	* [r710] Try to fix autorun issue
	  Try to fix version name in changelogs
	* [r709] autorun shold be executable so under pkgdata_PROGRAMS now
	  (rpmlint error)

2006-07-22  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r706] Fix screen corruption during restore in 'Configure LVM'
	  phase:
	  * Removed superfluous echo command in analyze-my-lvm.
	  * Removed superfluous (and wrong) vgremove_sz command in
	  mondo-prep.c.
	* [r705] Fixed bug where image partitions (e.g. NTFS) would change
	  size if Ok was
	  pressed in edit mountlist item dialog.
	* [r704] Check whether RAID sync is delayed for partition _before_
	  opening sync
	  pop-up to avoid screen corruption in mondorestore's newt mode.

2006-07-21  bcornec

	* [r702] - Exclude mvfs type of filesystem (ClearCase) from mondo
	  backup completely.
	  - RMLL announce
	* [r697] Manages Obsoletes for Suse (Lars Rupp suggestion from
	  SUSE)
	* [r696] Manages obsoletes for Mandriva to make update work.
	* [r695] Remove slang requires as they are brought by newt (fedora
	  suggestion)
	* [r694] Indication for users of IDE burners and 2.6 kernels
	  (Suggestion from Moriarity, Christopher <cdm7_at_cdc.gov>
	* [r693] Attempt to fix bug #7421 Unable to backup filenames with
	  pattern *\'*
	  (https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=7421&group_id=2524)
	  by adding a test on ' detection and launching the popen with "
	  instead.
	  The real problem here is the usage of popen which should be
	  avoided for that.
	* [r691] Busybox's df doesn't support -P.
	  Looking for a bug where e2label not called in nuke mode but not
	  found yet, except if it's related to that problem. (seen in the
	  logs)

2006-07-06  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r686] Doubled MAX_TAPECATALOG_ENTRIES to 8192 and increased
	  bkpinfo->optimal_set_size to 16MB for both streaming and
	  non-streaming
	  backups to avoid problem where afio says 'No space left on
	  device'
	  because we've run out of tape catalog entries.
	  
	  Note that this is a temporary measure which will be replaced by
	  dynamic
	  memory configuration soon(ish).
	  
	  This is also the fix for Debian Bug #369321. Further details can
	  be
	  found there.
	* [r685] Only ask "Is your computer a laptop, or does the CD writer
	  incorporate
	  BurnProof technology?" if the device to archive to is NOT a DVD
	  writer
	  because it is not needed in this case but rather gives an error
	  because
	  growisofs does not support the '-m' switch. See also check and
	  comment
	  in libmondo-tools.c saying "// -m isn't supported by growisofs,
	  BTW...".

2006-06-26  bcornec

	* [r684] Attempt to fix Bug #7820 Does not backup a file greater
	  than 2 GB
	  Report from taps23@yahoo.com
	  Changed legnth_of_file to off_t for ftello support and all
	  relative changes made as well in various functions to be
	  consistent

2006-06-25  bcornec

	* [r683] Preparation for 1.0.9/2.0.9
	  Add packman in links for website

2006-06-25  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r681] Replaced all occurrences of egrep with 'grep -E' and of
	  fgrep with
	  'grep -F' in mondo.
	  egrep and fgrep are usually just script wrappers around grep
	  these
	  days which means additional overhead compared to calling grep
	  with the
	  relevant option. Also, it appears that egrep and fgrep have been
	  deprecated by POSIX some time ago.
	* [r680] Replace occurrences of 'grep -v ... | grep -v ... | ...'
	  with 'grep -Ev
	  ...' for efficiency reasons and to ease trouble-shooting.
	  
	  This also fixes Debian bug #222052.
	* [r679] Avoid false alerts about growisofs not running under sudo.
	  This is
	  achieved by examining the growisofs binary and searching exactly
	  one
	  occurrence of the string SUDO_COMMAND. This test is designed to
	  avoid false positives. Note that this check is only required for
	  growisofs and not for other tools that may be used in the future
	  to
	  write DVDs.
	  
	  To enhance usability, the associated error message will now also
	  appear
	  in a pop-up rather than just as part of a bunch of diagnostics
	  output on
	  the command line.

2006-06-24  bcornec

	* [r678] Fix a bug in analyze-my-lvm for RHEL3 where vgdisplay
	  prints an additional field sometimes (#). Report and proposal by
	  severine.lombardo_at_acoss.fr
	* [r677] Increase PPCFG_RAMDISK_SIZE to 350 MB to avoid some bug
	  reported when doing full backups with big disks (Thomas Börkel)

2006-06-21  bcornec

	* [r676] Removed useless mondo-makefilelist (Andree Leidenfrost)

2006-06-11  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r671] Replaced *pos++ and *pos-- with pos += 1 and pos -= 1,
	  respectively.
	  Fixes gcc 4.1.2 warnings 'warning: value computed is not used'.
	  (Really
	  I think the warnings are bogus, but I wanted to get rid of them
	  and the
	  changes do not do any harm.)
	* [r670] Do the usual strcpy() and paranoid_free() after first
	  asprintf() in
	  parse_mdstat() to avoid segmentation fault.
	* [r669] Removed cruft from prepare_filelist() including variable
	  p_res. Fixes
	  gcc 4.1.2 warning 'warning: value computed is not used'.
	* [r668] Explicitely terminate token after strncpy() in mr_strok()
	  as strncpy()
	  does not do this. Fixes mdstat parsing errors.
	* [r667] Removed strcmp() call which wasn't evaluated from
	  open_device_via_buffer(). Fixes gcc 4.1.2 warning 'warning:
	  statement
	  with no effect'.

2006-06-10  bcornec

	* [r665] 2.0.8-4 preparation

2006-05-23  bcornec

	* [r572] gentoo build continued
	  mindi bug found due to a previous bug corrected (5.6 MB disks
	  generated systematically):
	  - when a disk less than 2.8 MB can be built,
	  not enough modules are put on it to support SCSI cds
	  (use of FLOPPY_MODS only). I added most CDROMs modules
	  in order to support them.

2006-05-22  bcornec

	* [r568] mondo-doc spec should work better and install target
	  mondo.spec avoids duplicates

	* [r565] strtok wasn't completely replaced :-(
	* [r560] memmove removed for raid management in favour of asprintf
	* [r559] strtok removed in favour of mr_strtok
	* [r558] Andree Leidenfrost adds mdadm/dm support. Hurray !
	  Of course I omit to mentioned that the previous patch was already
	  his work. (mr_strtok)
	* [r557] Addition of a mr_strtok function in mr string livrary.
	  Will allow parse_mdstat integration, and also usage by other
	  functions.
	  Tested with valgrind - memory management OK

2006-05-18  bcornec

	* [r556] mondo-doc should now generate

2006-05-17  bcornec

	* [r555] tag also used during setup phase in .spec
	* [r554] Add new tag variable in spec and corresponding TTT macro
	  in m4 files for filename correct handling during build
	* [r553] Build process in 3 steps:
	  svn2build creates tar files from SVN (works mostly)
	  build2pkg creates packages from tar files (works mostly)
	  build2qemu (has to be created from mkqemu) will create packages
	  for all supported virtuel machines

	* [r542] merge -r436:517 $SVN_M/branches/2.0.7
	  stable is now again at 2.0.8 initial
	* [r541] Stable is reverted to r436 (2.0.7) to put it in line with
	  2.0.8 and start from there over
	* [r538] Begining of modifications => DOS NOT WORK FOR NOW.
	  This is done to be merged in trunk. stable will later point back
	  to current 2.0.8 content
	  
	  Use of mindi conf file in mindi + /var/cache/mindi as a default
	  place
	  Use of mondo conf file in mondo + separation of messages.
	  Ultimate goal is to have a cleaner design of files vs functions.

2006-05-11  bcornec

	* [r392] Made it so that mondoarchive aborts when 'mindi
	  --findkernel' gives a
	  fatal error and outputs mindi's fatal error message in a newt
	  popup.
	  This should help making it easier for users to get to the core of
	  the
	  problem in case mindi fails.
	  (See also Debian bug #352323.)

2006-02-14  bcornec

	* [r390] New location for the future conf file in the SVN
	* [r388] RPMs are now made with a .spec containing m4 macros

2006-02-12  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	  It takes up 63KB of space, hasn't had an update upstream in five
	  years,
	  isn't used in MondoRescue as far as I can tell - certainly it

2005-12-08  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r169] Fixed issue where mondoarchive ejects CD/DVD despite
	  writing iso images.
	* [r167] Consistently use get_phys_size_of_drive() to determine the
	  maximum
	  amount of data to be read in slice_up_file_etc().
	  
	  See also Debian bugs #318694 and #273980.
	* [r165] Add -P option to df call to ensure that partition names
	  are correctly
	  extracted when devfs is used.
	  
	  Patch provided by Chuan-kai Lin - thank you!
	  
	  See also Debian bug #295592.
	* [r163] Make it so that the -B option script does run even if
	  specified in
	  conjunction with the -m option (manual CD tray).
	  
	  Based on a patch by Efraim Feinstein - thank you!
	  
	  See also Debian bug #278000.
	* [r161] Avoid overwriting the already correctly determined disk
	  size by moving
	  the relevant code inside the if clause that checks the validity
	  of the
	  previously calculated disk size.
	* [r159] Quadrupled ARBITRARY_MAXIMUM from 500 to 2000 to reduce
	  the likelihood
	  of not all files being displayed in mondorestore's filebrowser.
	  See also Debian bug #275385.

2005-12-08  bcornec

	* [r157] Prepare changelogs for 2.06/1.06 release

2005-12-07  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r155] Advertise the fact that mindi has failed more prominently
	  by using
	  function popup_and_OK() rather than log_to_screen() in function
	  call_mindi_to_supply_boot_disks().
	* [r154] Evaluate errno to find out whether an external command
	  succeeded or not
	  in function run_program_and_log_to_screen(). This ensures amongst
	  other
	  things that we terminate if mindi fails rather than happily
	  continuing
	  and throwing an incomprehensible error later down the track
	  because no
	  floppy images exist.
	* [r153] Added check for sudo when writing DVDs and terminate if
	  sudo used
	  because growisofs does't support sudo.
	* [r152] Fix two compiler warnings:
	  - intialise variable 'incoming' (mondo-rstr-tools.c)
	  - only define structure 'buf' if architecture is IA64
	  (libmondo-devices.c)

2005-12-02  bcornec

	* [r148] - Bug on USB keyboard corrected

	  - cosmetic messages improvement for mindi
	  - use STD_PREFIX

2005-11-22  bcornec

	* [r132] Fix bugs for cifs support

2005-11-19  bcornec

	* [r128] indent on all the C code
	* [r126] This patch avoids useless invocations of `cat <file> |'
	  where the second
	  process in the pipe can more efficiently read its input file
	  itself.
	  It replaces also some `grep'+`sed' commands by an unique `sed'
	  command.
	  This patch also improves readability of shell commands by
	  replacing \" by ' where possible.
	  This patch instructs mondo to say `DVD' instead of `CD' when
	  appropriate.
	  This patch forces growisofs to use speed=1 for DVD burning. In my
	  experience, DVD burning time is only a small part of the total
	  backup
	  time so this should not make a big difference in backup time, but
	  a big one in reliability of mondo. On my installation, without
	  the option `speed=1', mondo/growisofs is unable to burn a DVD.
	  With
	  the option `speed=1', mondo works.
