# v2.2.28-1 (01-Aug-2013)

First upload to AUR. Package was built a long time ago, but I'd tinkered with
the PKGBUILD since, so didn't pass the tests (make check), nor build fully
linked libraries. (specifically, the `-rpath` and related options)

#  v2.2.28-2 (01-Aug-2013)

Minor fix (read hack) to get around test failures, but was still partially broken.


#  v2.2.28-3 (01-Aug-2013)

Fix up the link flags, after remembering how it worked before. Added
description in PKGBUILD, documenting the desired -rpath options and why they
are needed.

#  v2.2.28-4 (02-Aug-2013)

Get the package to build successfully when Intel compilers are in use, as
specified in the effective makepkg.conf.

Works for me, with:
	- icc (ICC) 13.1.3 20130607
	- icpc (ICC) 13.1.3 20130607
