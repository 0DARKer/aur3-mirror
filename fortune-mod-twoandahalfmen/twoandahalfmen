Alan: Hey, well, here's an idea: Why don't you run downstairs to the embalming room and see if you can score a couple of fresh ones off the truck?
Charlie: Excuse me, but considering your ex-wife, I'd say you're the expert on having sex with cold women who don't move!

Alan: Have you no shame?!
Charlie: Let me think. Nope, just a tug.
Alan: Now that's another thing! My angst is real. I-- I do not appreciate you taking my tug and using it to get in someone's pants.

Alan: Me? What would make you think of me?
Charlie: Well, I figured you get laid less often than a boil-covered dwarf, am I right?
Alan: I don't have the actual statistics, but go on.
Charlie: Well, you must get really frustrated. I mean, how do you stop yourself from, you know, running a red light and then taunting the cop 'til he shoots you?
Alan: Ah, good question. Uh, I found that the best thing to do is to focus on your career, uh, get a hobby, uh, become involved in community activities, and at the end of the day, if you have any energy left, find a quiet space and yank it like a monkey in a mango tree.

Jerome: Hey, Jake.
Jake: (intimidated) Hello, sir.
Jerome: (calling) Celeste! Jake's here! (to Jake) So how've you been?
Jake: (still intimidated) We're walking down to the pier, we're gonna play skee ball, we'll be back by 11.

Gordon: [delivering pizza] Hey Mr. Harper.
Charlie: Oh, hey Gordon! It's been a long time.
Gordon: Yeah, two years.
Charlie: So what have you been up to?
Gordon: Well, I finished night school, got my business degree, met an amazing girl and got married, landed a great job as a stock brocker, the company went under, my wife left me and - uh - that'll be 28.50.

Alan: Oh, uh, here, let me, uh, move the snickerdoodles.
Gordon: [sighs] Snickerdoodles.
Alan: You don't like them?
Gordon: No, no, I do. It's just that my wife used to call me her little snickerdoodle.
Charlie: You're kidding.
Gordon: Well, no, not all of me. It was her little nickname for my, uh... [awkward chuckle]
Jerome: Oh, that is a terrible name for a penis.
Gordon: Oh, yeah? What did your wife call yours?
Jerome: Mr. Roundtree. [everyone stares] Shaft? [everyone murmurs in agreement]
Alan: That's way better than "snickerdoodle".
Herb: Judith calls mine "that thing".
Alan: As in, "Get that thing away from me"?
Herb: Yeah, how did you know?
Alan: Just a guess.

Evelyn: Look, Charlie, if you're really going to marry this woman, I want to get started on the right foot. I don't want to make the same mistake I did with Alan's wife June.
Charlie: Judith.
Evelyn: Oh, whatever. Heinous woman. The fact remains, had I overlooked that and welcomed her into the family, she wouldn't have kept me at arm's length all during Jake's formative years and I'd have a better relationship with him today.
Charlie: Do you want a better relationship with him?
Evelyn: Not the way he is now! But if I'd gotten to him earlier, he wouldn't have the manners of an outhouse rat.

Chelsea: Did you ask if he wants to go to the movies with us?
Charlie: No.
Chelsea: Why not?
Charlie: Because he's a ticking time bomb and we don't wanna be in the car with him when he goes off!
Chelsea: Come on, he's breaking my heart. Staying home all alone on a Friday night.
Charlie: Don't worry. You know how they say you can be alone, but not lonely?
Chelsea: Yeah?
Charlie: Well, Alan's kinda the opposite. He's always lonely, but he's never alone.
Chelsea: He's going through a tough time. Your brother should be surrounded by friends and family.
