Buy the full version of UnReal World

UnReal World is a shareware game, which means that you can freely download and play the unregistered trial version to decide whether you like it or not. If you do, you can register (buy) your copy of UrW. This way you will get to play the full version of the game without the limitations of the unregistered version. The process is fast, easy and reliable and the most inexpensive full version registration costs only $3 USD. 

1. Current version registration

You'll get: current UnReal World version


Current version registration is an inexpensive way to get to experience the game up to its' full potential if you don't wish to purchase a more long-term license on the basis of trial version only - or if you just must get your hands on the full current version for a low, nominal fee. Should there be any showstopping bugs found within the current version, the bugfix versions are also included in the license.

2. Lifetime registration

You'll get: current + all the becoming UnReal World versions as long as you and the game do exist.

A lifetime registration is a long term investment and truly a lifetime registration: every single new release and update of the game are playable to you as a full and complete registered versions. If you are wondering for how long UrW has existed already, the answer is two decades. See Development section for more information.
