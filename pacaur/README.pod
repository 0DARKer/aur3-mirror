=head1 DESCRIPTION

pacaur is an Arch User Repository (AUR) helper aiming at speed and simplicity,
designed to allow a fast workflow and to use an uncluttered interface. It is
build upon the well designed cower and expac C backends. Invoking pacaur
consists of supplying an operation, any applicable options, and usually one or
more targets.

=head1 OPERATIONS

multiple targets will return the result of the intersection of all query
results. Extended regex patterns as defined by POSIX are allowed.

=item B<-i, --info>

=item B<-d, --download>

Download I<target> PKGBUILD. Pass this option twice to fetch dependencies (done
recursively).

=item B<-m, --makepkg>

Download I<target> PKGBUILD and build target. Missing dependencies will B<not>
be installed as required, thus needing manual intervention if any problem
occurs.

=item B<-y, --sync>

will be automatically installed as required.

Check foreign packages for updates in the AUR. Without any arguments, all
manually installed packages will be checked. If targets are supplied, only
those targets will be checked.

=item B<-u, --update>

installed packages will be updated. If targets are supplied, only those targets
will be updated.

Additionally, pacaur wraps B<pacman operations> and extends respectively its
install, search, info, download, update, check updates and clean functions to
the AUR.
