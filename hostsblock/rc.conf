# FINAL HOSTSFILE
# The final hosts file that combines together all downloaded blocklists. If not using dnsmasq, this should be /etc/hosts
# hostsblock recycles entries from your original file, in the event that a blocklist cannot be downloaded, or so that 
# loopback entries won't be list.

hostsfile=/etc/hosts.block

# REDIRECT URL
# url to localhost to redirect blocked hosts. This replaces any entries to 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1

# USE DNSMASQ
# If selected, it will check to see if dnsmasq is running and, if it is, restart it to update its cache with new entries, or,
# of not, start it

# The configuration file of dnsmasq, if you use it.

# File containing hosts file entries which you want at the beginning of the resultant hosts file, e.g. for loopback devices and
# IPV6 entries

# BLACKLISTED DOMAINS
# File containing specific subdomains to blacklist which may not be in the downloaded blacklists.
# Be sure to provide not just the domain, e.g. "google.com", but also the specific subdomain "adwords.google.com"
# without quotations

blacklist=/etc/hostsblock/black.list

# WHITELIST
# File containing the specific subdomains to allow through that may be blocked by the downloaded blocklists.
# Put a space in front of a string in order to let through that specific site (without quotations), e.g.
# " www.malwaredomainlists.com" or leave no space, which will remove all entries that contain the given string,
# e.g. ".dropbox.com" will let through "www.dropbox.com", "dl.www.dropbox.com", "foo.dropbox.com", "bar.dropbox.com", etc.

whitelist=/etc/hostsblock/white.list

# BLOCKLISTS
# list all blocklists to be downloaded as an array
# Files may be either plaintext, zip, or 7z files. Hostsfiles will identify zip and 7z files by their file extension.
