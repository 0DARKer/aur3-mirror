# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings 
#                       instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=permissive
# SELINUXTYPE= takes the name of SELinux policy to
# be used. Default policy for Arch Linux is:
# 	refpolicy
