==> byobu installation notes:
    -------------------------------------------------
    /!\ There have been heavy changes in byobu.
        Config is now in \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME which
        should default to '~/.config/byobu'.

    Also note that the updates_available script is
    now working on Arch; to use it, you should run
    'pacman -Sy' regularly (e.g. as a root cron task)
