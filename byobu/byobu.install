==> byobu installation notes:
    -------------------------------------------------
    /!\ There have been heavy changes in byobu.
        Config is now in \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME which
        should default to '~/.config/byobu'.

    There is a preliminary support of tmux (instead of
    screen) as a backend, see /etc/byobu/backend.
    Use it at your own risk.
