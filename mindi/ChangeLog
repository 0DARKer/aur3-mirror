	* [r2532] r3751@localhost: bruno | 2010-01-08 14:03:56 +0100
	  LVM excludion based on devices was flawed as the function
	  targeted was not really useful. That script shold be fully
	  rewritten to have a data structure contaiing what is needed.
	  Anyway the current patch should allow to have some improvements

	* [r2433] ssh in the restore env needs some dlopened libs
	  (libnss_compat|files)
	* [r2432] Warning emited in case of duplicate mountpoints or
	  devices in fstab found
	* [r2431] - Use only the AWK veriable everywhere and not the awk
	  command
	* [r2429] - Simplify GetInitrdFilesystemToUse which doesn't need to
	  detect everything, but just know if it's initramfs (new mode) or
	  a compressed FS ext2/3 (older mode) as initrd is anyway re-made
	  by mindi. Should fix #353

2009-09-25  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r2425] - Improving ssh support at restore time by providing a
	  shadow file
	* [r2424] - analyze-my-lvm now removes excluded devices from list
	  coming from mondoarchive
	  - new mr_make_devlist_from_pathlist which handle the new
	  bkpinfo->exclude_devs field containing the excluded devices and
	  remove corresponding code from libmondo-cli.c
	  - Move DSF code into libmondo-devices.c for coherency, and only
	  the previous function is made externally available
	  - Remove dev_to_exclude in libmondo-archive.c which wasn't
	  working correctly and replace it with bkpinfo->exclude_devs

	  embedded feature in the future (sshfs, live install). The other
	  conf files contain the additional commands to put in the
	  all.tar.gz. For the moment, mindi is still working the same. THis
	  infra will allow that support in a near future. deplist.txt is
	  now reserved for the admin additional commands.

	* [r1724] If udev then adds modprobe/insmod to rootfs
	* [r1723] - tty0 is also cretaed with udev
	  - ide-generic put rather in DENY_MODS
	* [r1722] - udevd remove from deplist s handled in mindi directly
	  - better default for mindi when using --usb
	* [r1721] - Handles dynamically linked busybox (in case we want to
	  use it soon ;-)
	  - Adds fixed devices to create for udev
	  - ide-generic should not be part of the initrd when using libata
	  v2
	  - support a dynamically linked udev (case on Ubuntu 7.10 and
	  Mandriva 2008.0 so should be quite generic)
	  This will give incitation to move to dyn. linked binaries in the
	  initrd which will help for other tasks (ia64)
	* [r1720] Intermediate step for tests: udevd is dynamically linked
	  so we will need to support dyn linked ninaries earlier at restore
	  time, which leads to the usage of a dyn linked busybox (good
	  thing in itself, but implies lots of rework and checks)
	* [r1719] Improvement in udev support (do not use cl options not
	  available in busybox)
	* [r1718] - Still working on udev support in mindi
	  - auto creation of the right links at boot time with
	  udev-links.conf(from Mandriva 2008.0)
	  - rework startup of udev as current makes kernel crash (from
	  Mandriva 2008.0)
	  - add support for 64 bits udev
	  - Try to render MyInsmod silent at boot time
	* [r1717] typo
	* [r1716] Adds udev support (mandatory for newest distributions to
	  avoid remapping of devices in a different way as on the original
	  system)

2006-10-08  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r884] That mindi modif should not have go in, my fault.
	* [r882] - Build process reviewed to fix again bug #79
	  - MONDOTMP now used uniformaly across all scripts
	  - mandriva has its own set of variables
	  - svn2build should now generate directories in the right place

2006-10-05  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r876] Update ChangeLogs for 2.2.0 preparation

2006-10-05  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r875] Just check for libncurses in wait-for-petris to avoid
	  problem with libc
	  possibly being in /lib/tls. Double the waiting time to 2 seconds
	  instead and keep respawning petris perpetually.

2006-10-04  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r872] Fix bug #79 by removing use of SVNBRANCH and BASE variable
	  in build process
	  WARNING: the build process doesn't allow anymore to use the
	  script of one version for building another version

2006-10-03  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r870] - Checks variables berfore getting them from env during
	  restore
	  - source start-nfs to get env. Var. correctly set for
	  mondorestore

2006-10-03  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r868] Removed check for linker in wait-for-petris. It is too
	  much of a moving
	  target and ensuring we don't start petris prematurely works
	  without it.

2006-10-02  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r866] - tabs inserted for scripts
	  - MyInsmod should be less verbose

	* [r861] Fix bugs on ReadAllLink and use it more
	* [r860] Create function ReadAllLink in mindi used by LocateFile
	  now to try to optimize it. Hope mindi will now get all libraries
	  correctly
	* [r859] remove a partial patch for x86_64: ldconfig is not needed.
	  What is missing are the library files (symlinks). So rewrite of
	  ProcessLDD.
	  deplost.txt updated accordingly.
	  LocateFile in mindi has been replaced by readlink for all the
	  usages linked to symlinks.
	* [r858] Typo in deplist.txt
	* [r857] Use the native module management and not busybox's one
	* [r856] busybox doesn't provide bzip2 so bunzip2 is useless in
	  fact
	  many command should now be used from busybox rather than
	  duplicated.
	  still a problem on ldconfig on x86_64 to be solved, as libc.so.6
	  is not created as a correct link
	* [r855] The fix for SWAP LABEL wasn't complete. Now mindi
	  --makemountlist is working on RHEL4 x86_64

2006-09-28  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r854] Fix for #72 (usbhid module added to mindi)

	  ChangeLog added)

2006-09-23  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r821] Addition of busybox 1.2.1 as a mindi-busybox new package
	  This should avoid delivering binary files in mindi not built
	  there (Fedora and Debian are quite serious about that)
	* [r819] Exclude ppc arch architecture as it is not supported by
	  mindi (For fedora extras as per
	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=187317)

	* [r763] - Remove Berlios references where obsolete
	  - Improve mindi patch for LVM on Debian
	  - bzip2 now created during svn2build, and used later by othe

	* [r748] Seems I got it for LVM and LABEL
	* [r747] mindi was accidentaly destroyed. Restored now
	* [r746] - Still trying to fix LABEL + LVM in mindi
	  - Removed some X11 files remaining
	  - remove some ps options not available with busybox
	  - Use LOGFILE constantly in init & LogIt

2006-08-04  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r745] Still on LVM !!
	* [r744] With that version mindi --makemountlist works for RHEL4 +
	  LVMv2 + LABEL
	* [r742] - start-nfs is a sh script (not bash)
	  - removing start-nfs generation broke also mindi, so test now
	  with file NFS-DEV instead
	* [r741] - Fix a bug for LVM where current_lvolume wasn't not
	  re-initialized at each time (in a loop)
	  - Introduces LVM and LVMCMD as global var for mindi (idea taken
	  from init)
	  - header for start-nfs

	  No more generation in init (variable substitution errors thus
	  avoided)
	* [r739] Fix bug in start-nfs: $ needs to be escaped in that env.

2006-08-03  Bruno Cornec <bruno@project-builder.org>

	* [r737] Big NFS+PXE migration: start-nfs is not created by
	  mondoarchive, but on the fly by init during restore. This allows
	  more flexibility to restore through NFS a backup created on disks
	  e.g. and simplify code.
	* [r736] Better check for vgchange launch in start-lvm
	* [r735] Attempt to fix for Bug #8

	  The non-net is still a very old (and small version)

2006-07-22  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r706] Fix screen corruption during restore in 'Configure LVM'
	  phase:
	  * Removed superfluous echo command in analyze-my-lvm.
	  * Removed superfluous (and wrong) vgremove_sz command in
	  mondo-prep.c.

2006-07-22  bcornec

	  Cards
	  (Bug #6455
	  https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=6455&group_id=2524)
	* [r690] - Better error message when LABEL is found for non mounted
	  partition (USB dev e.g.) (report from David Giddy
	  <d.giddy_at_bigpond.com>)
	  - Fix a bug with redhat_label not initialized in the loop

	* [r683] Preparation for 1.0.9/2.0.9
	  Add packman in links for website

2006-06-25  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r682] Replaced all occurrences of egrep with 'grep -E' and of
	  fgrep with
	  'grep -F' in mindi.
	  egrep and fgrep are usually just script wrappers around grep
	  these
	  days which means additional overhead compared to calling grep
	  with the
	  relevant option. Also, it appears that egrep and fgrep have been
	  deprecated by POSIX some time ago.

2006-06-24  bcornec

	* [r678] Fix a bug in analyze-my-lvm for RHEL3 where vgdisplay

	  and with
	  lvmcreate_initrd and pvdata which don't exist in LVM2 whilst
	  analysing
	  dependency requirements.
	  
	  Also fixes Debian bug #351687.

2006-06-17  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r674] Handle the following format used by some distributions,
	  e.g. Debian, for
	  LVM devices:
	  
	  /dev/mapper/<VG>-<LV>
	  
	  in addition to /dev/<VG>/<LV> where the latter is a link to the
	  former.
	  
	  This is a fix for Debian bug #362926.

2006-06-12  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r673] Use bash rather than sh in analyze-my-lvm to be clear
	  about what shell
	  will work and to avoid problems with less powerful shell
	  alternatives.
	  This also brings things in line with mindi.

2006-06-10  bcornec

	* [r665] 2.0.8-4 preparation

	  install.sh but not neces
	  sarily defined outside my build process

2006-06-04  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r623] Make the init script mdadm-aware, i.e. make it look for

	* [r572] gentoo build continued
	  mindi bug found due to a previous bug corrected (5.6 MB disks
	  generated systematically):
	  - when a disk less than 2.8 MB can be built,
	  not enough modules are put on it to support SCSI cds
	  (use of FLOPPY_MODS only). I added most CDROMs modules
	  in order to support them.

	* [r541] Stable is reverted to r436 (2.0.7) to put it in line with
	  2.0.8 and start from there over
	* [r538] Begining of modifications => DOS NOT WORK FOR NOW.
	  This is done to be merged in trunk. stable will later point back

2006-02-17  bcornec

	* [r401] - Integrate some SuSE patches and spec tips
	  - all the doc is now under documentation (man pages, pdf,
	  generated doc)
	  - delivery process adapted consequently
	* [r399] - man pages reviewed
	  - pdf, ps, txt and html generated from man pages and published on
	  the Web
	  - Bob is in the thanks page for 2nd DNS server

2006-02-14  bcornec

	* [r389] small cleanup (Web + RPM)
	* [r388] RPMs are now made with a .spec containing m4 macros
	  expanded with tools/mkrpm
	  this allows for a simpler spec file at the end,
	  which should be suited for at least Mandriva official packages.
	  Added a new mkspec tool which does the expansion
	  This way of dealing with distributions will be used is some other
	  areas in the future

2006-02-12  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r383] Get mindi to look for analyze-my-lvm in it's library
	  directory MINDI_LIB
	  rather than the path. analyze-my-lvm should not be in the path
	  because
	  it is only useful to mindi. A second reason, particularly for
	  Debian, is
	  that it does not have a manpage - Debian requires all executables
	  to
	  have one.
	  (See also Debian bug #351446.)
	* [r381] Fixed mindi so that it only deletes freshly created 1440kb
	  boot and root
	  floppy images if creation finished with an error.
	  (See also Debian Bug #348966.)
	* [r380] Added modules 'via82cxxx' and 'generic' to IDE_MODS to
	  ensure they are
	  getting loaded early. This avoids problems with hard disks not
	  being
	  found when VIA controllers are used with later 2.6 kernels.
	* [r377] Made it so that wait-for-petris picks the correct linker
	  for the
	  architecture at hand rather than just looking for
	  /lib/ld-linux.so.2
	  which only exists on i386. This fixes calling petris on amd64
	  (and
	  hopefully on ia64, too).

2006-02-09  bcornec

	* [r365] the busybox mount should be called with -o ro when working
	  with read-only media to mount in PXE case.
	  this should correct the bug reported on RHEL 3 with PXE.

2006-01-27  bcornec

	* [r349] mindi now supports a 2.6 failsafe kernel

2006-01-26  bcornec

	* [r347] Fix a dependancy issue. Mindi now depends on grep >= 2.5
	  (for -m option). Update for rh and mdk/mdv
	  (reported by Marco Puggelli <marco.puggelli-ho@autostrade.it>)

2006-01-25  bcornec

	* [r346] Fix a bug in LVM context for RHEL4 where non integer
	  numbers were returned by GetValueFromField instead of integers.
	  (patch from remi.bondoin_at_regis-dgac.net)

2006-01-24  bcornec

	* [r345] busybox config file was not up to date with the binary
	  delivered

2006-01-20  bcornec

	* [r339] This version is stable so VESION files updated

2006-01-19  bcornec

	* [r333] Create the stable branch from 2.06 which is now in
	  maintenance mode only

2006-01-15  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r321] Swap out partimagehack in favour of ntfsclone deplist.txt
	  to satisfy the
	  requirements of the new NTFS imaging code.

2006-01-14  bcornec

	* [r318] - spec files are now under distributions as well
	  - rpm build process revised accordingly

2006-01-13  bcornec

	* [r316] Preparation to support official mandriva builds
	* [r315] - svn.log now part of the rpms
	  - .spec factorisation continues (mkrel, requires, ...)
	* [r314] which is not a requirement for SuSE as a separate rpm
	  package
	* [r313] spec file generation adapted (RRR used for revision,
	  suffix now has the '.', Group is now a variable)
	* [r312] MINDI_LIB var is now correct on x86_64
	* [r311] - no Mindi in install.sh anymore
	  - mkrpm now use svn log correctly from the right place

2006-01-12  bcornec

	* [r308] gentoo build files added for mindi as well
	* [r306] mindi now support x86_64 installation under /usr/lib64
	* [r305] use df -P everywhere to avoid split lines on df output and
	  some bugs
	* [r303] Include the result of svn log -v in the tar files
	  generated for RPM build.

2006-01-11  bcornec

	* [r301] Updated to busybox 1.1.0 for the net version
	* [r299] Avoids an error message when invoking lvmscandisk
	* [r298] introduce variable LVMCMD depending on LVM version to
	  simplify the code.
	* [r297] ListUnsavedKernelModules and ListKernelModules are gone
	  (the first is wrong the second useless)

2006-01-10  bcornec

	* [r294] - removed microwerks references
	  - document changelogs
	* [r291] avoids to copy 5670 KB disks to floppy
	* [r290] stop creating further size of floppy disks if the smaller
	  one succeeds.
	* [r289] Abort when one of the include dirs (-I) does not exist
	  (bug reported by jeff@jlsworld.com)
	  A warning is also logged for the -E option

2006-01-06  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r287] Modified and streamlined init:
	  - new function 'ExtractDataDisksAndLoadModules()' loads files
	  from
	  floppy or <n>.tar.gz images and subsequently loads modules to
	  take
	  advantage of the modules previously loaded
	  - removed now unnecessary second general module loading phase
	  which
	  speeds booting up somewhat
	  - start NFS only once all possible modules are loaded - for PXE
	  this is
	  immediately as beofre because everything is in the initrd, for
	  ordinary NFS this is after the images and then the modules have
	  been
	  loaded
	  The long-term solution as disucssed on the mailing-list will
	  probably be
	  to make the contents of mindi's 'NET_MODS' variable complete and
	  dynamic. Until this happens the above change will do.
	* [r285] Changed module 'nfsacl' to 'nfs_acl' in mindi's 'NET_MODS'
	  variable and
	  added 'nfs_acl' to mindi's 'EXTRA_MODS' variable.
	  On Debian Sid with kernel 2.6.15-1-k7-smp as at 06 Jan 06 we
	  have:
	  andree@aurich3:~/shed/mr/svn.berlios$ lsmod | grep nfs
	  nfs 198600 2
	  lockd 57224 2 nfs
	  nfs_acl 3840 1 nfs
	  sunrpc 137980 4 nfs,lockd,nfs_acl
	  So, module 'nfs' depends on module 'nfs_acl'. This is assumed to
	  be
	  solely kernel-dependent, i.e. not Debian-specific.

2006-01-04  bcornec

	* [r283] Latest busybox for PXE tests
	* [r281] Mindi/DiskSize is gone (problem on case insensitive FS)
	  useless

2006-01-03  bcornec

	* [r277] replaced sort | uniq with sort -u
	* [r275] more cat commands removed
	* [r273] Patches from Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni
	  <maddingue@free.fr>
	  
	  replace several occurences of "cat .. | grep .."
	  or with similar commands that accept filenames as arguments.
	  + some sort | uniq replaced by sort -u

2005-12-30  Andree Leidenfrost <andree@debian.org>

	* [r271] Replace the contents of the README files for mondo and
	  mindi with
	  something hopefully slightly more useful.
	  Given that MondoRescue hosting is in a state of flux, I'll be
	  happy to
	  update things once the dust has settled (or before if required).

	* [r138] Correction on Philippe De Muyter's patch not completely

2005-11-24  bcornec

	* [r134] initial spaces => tabs in mindi (bcornec)
	  
	  From Wolfgang Rosenauer <wolfgang_at_rosenauer.org>:
	  
	  For some commands (tar, tr and find) the patch just changes the
	  ordering of
	  parameters because newer versions (at least on Linux) complain
	  about the
	  wrong ordering. (For tr this is the blocker on SUSE Linux because
	  the
	  dependency list cannot be created correctly).
	  
	  The patch also does some more cleanup (and fixes cleanup as for
	  mindi.err/) at exit.
	  
	  Cosmetical changes are some changes to log-messages as (invalid)
	  line
	  numbers or wrong characters.
	  
	  Another thing is that image creation now uses the same random
	  name for
	  the mountpoint as well as for the image and again cleans up in
	  the error
	  handler. In 1.05 there were mindi mounts active after running
	  mindi.

2005-11-19  bcornec

	* [r124] add MINDI_CONF to the mindi LOGFILE (The warning that we
	  use /etc/mindi/deplist.txt should be bigger, but that is a first
	  step)
	  In that case mindi loops fdisk'ing -l /dev/ida/c*d*, including
	  the
	  /dev/ida/c*d*p*, which is useless, but consumes an enormous
	  amount of time.
	  The patch also includes some debugging enhancement
	  (Philippe De Muyter)

	* [r100] svn merge -r77:78 of trunk (andree) :
	  The output of ldd coming with libc6 2.3.4 and higher has changed
	  and
	  breaks mindi's library inclusion code.
	  
	  The change makes it so that the code in ProcessLDD() wroks for
	  both
	  libc6 < 2.3.4 and >= 2.3.4.
	* [r97] Patch from Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni
	  <maddingue_AT_free.fr> to suppress some warnings issued by mindi
