depends=('libungif' 'libjpeg-turbo' 'djvulibre' 'libspectre' 'sdl') # I have tentatively removed the 'bison' and 'flex' deps since namcap indicates that they are not needed.  # I have also removed readline since it is required by bash.  I also removed libtiff as a dep, since it is required by djvulibre, which is required by fim.  
# namcap also listed libspectre as required but not included.  not sure what provides libpng that is already
# included as a dep, but namcap said that it was already satisfied.  
# I'm about to add sdl to the list of deps, per namcap.
