2012-02-25 Jason St. John <jstjohn .. purdue . edu>

	* 3.2.1-2:

	* 3.2.1-1:
	Changed package version numbering scheme to use three digits instead of
	   two.
	New upstream release (3.2.1).
	The OpenNebula Watch bug has been fixed; removed patching instructions
	   from PKGBUILD.
	The PKGBUILD now automatically detects whether to pass the '-k' switch to
	   ./install.sh when installing/upgrading. This means that your OpenNebula
	   config files won't get overwritten when upgrading anymore.
	Removed a few commented installation steps because it is far better to
	   just make the PKGBUILD do the 'vanilla' install and allow the user to
	   tweak it as necessary.

	Added optional installation methods to build() (in the PKGBUILD).
	Removed the oneuser.patch file from the PKGBUILD and tarball (the patch
	   was for OpenNebula 2.0).
	Significant improvements to /etc/rc.d/oned and the opennebula.install
	   script.
