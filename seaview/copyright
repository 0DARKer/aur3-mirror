Disclamer : This package is not part of the Debian operating system.
 The seaview source and binary Debian packages are part of the “non-free” area
 in our archive. The packages in this area are not part of the Debian system,
 although they have been configured for use with Debian. We nevertheless support
 the use of the seaview source and binary Debian packages and provide
 infrastructure for non-free packages (such as our bug tracking system and
 mailing lists). The licences of SeaView do not forbid Debian from using
 autobuilders to create binary packages.

	Linking PHYML statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on PHYML. 
	Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
	
	In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of PHYML give you permission to combine 
	PHYML with free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code 
	included in the standard release of PHYLIP under the University of Washington license (or modified 
	versions of such code, with unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following 
	the terms of the GNU GPL for PHYML and the licenses of the other code concerned.
	
	Note that people who make modified versions of PHYML are not obligated to grant this special exception 
	for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives 
	permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible 
	to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
