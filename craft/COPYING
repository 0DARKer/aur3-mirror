This source code is free, everybody may do everything with it, if it is not
used commercially. I guarantee absolutely nothing, everything is at your
own risk and I explicitly warn you not to compile or play the game :-).

By the way if there are a few guys who are interested in further development
of the game, mail me. I would be interested to hear your ideas and tips.
