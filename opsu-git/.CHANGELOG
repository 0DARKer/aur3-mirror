|   
|       Fixed crashes when importing beatmaps (due to more async issues).
|       Don't call MusicController.loopTrackIfEnded() if a beatmap reloading thread is running.
|       
|       Other changes:
|       - Fixed issue where long download result text would be drawn outside the result area by adding a clip.
|       - Changed default music offset from -150ms to -75ms.

| 
|     Minor main menu changes.
|     - Changed the time format displayed on the main menu to match osu!.
|     - If no beatmaps are loaded, redirect the user to the downloads menu instead of an empty song menu.
|     
|     Also, start showing bar notifications at time 1 instead of 0 so it can be called in enter() methods without visual delays.

| 
|     Game state bug fixes and better error handling.
|     Error handling (related to #53):
|     - Catch all exceptions caused by creating HitObjects and throw a more informative error with the hit object information. This also allows multiple errors to be reported, instead of crashing at the first error.
|     - Added a fallback "DummyObject" HitObject to replace hit objects causing errors, which should allow the game to function despite any errors.
|     - Added a toString() method to OsuHitObject (resembling the raw format).
|     
|     Bug fixes (caused by #52):
|     - Game is no longer paused when focus is lost during lead-in time or during breaks.
|     - Replay frames are no longer recorded when the game is paused.
|     - Pulsing cursor animation now works even during lead-in time.
|     - skipIntro() during replays now works properly.

| 
|     Glyph loading fixes and improvements (for Unicode fonts).
|     - Glyphs are now loaded for specific fonts as needed, not for all of them at once.  This reduces lag and saves memory.
|     - Fixed glyphs not being loaded in the downloads menu.
|     - Moved Utils.loadGlyphs() calls directly above text drawing code (easier to maintain, and fixes a bug with text flickering once).
|     
|     Also removed MusicController methods 'getTrackName()' and 'getArtistName()' (not needed).
