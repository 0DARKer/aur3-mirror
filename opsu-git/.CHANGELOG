| 
|     More graphical updates, some code cleanup, and minor fixes.
|     - The MenuButton class now fully supports hover effects (scale, fade, rotate) for Animations.
|     - Used a fixed location for the selection buttons in the song menu (previously based on the "back" button width, which varies widely in different skins).
|     - Added hover effects for "retry" and "exit" buttons in the ranking screen.
|     - Changed animation speed of back/skip buttons.
|     - Fixed a bug where main menu showed the incorrect number of songs loaded during searches.
|     - Removed unneeded draw() methods in Utils for color filters (since 69f5aa5).
|     - Moved Utils.drawCentered(Image, ...) into the Image class.
|     - Added overwritten Image class to Maven excludes.
