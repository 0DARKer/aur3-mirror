| 
|     TextField updates, and bug fixes from some recent commits.
|     - Added modified copy of slick.gui.TextField: added CTRL+BACKSPACE for word deletion, and disabled left/right arrows to move cursor and CTRL+Z to undo.
|     - Fixed musicEnded() incorrectly setting the "trackEnded" upon swapping tracks.  This has caused some nasty loops since #38.
|     - Fixed a null pointer exception in OsuDB from 0b03912.
|     - Fixed the song menu search bar transition being incorrectly reset when hitting backspace on a 0-length query.

|     Keep track of beatmap cache size.
|     The minimum batch loading size is now based on the beatmap cache size instead of an arbitrary constant.

| 
|     More optimizations: don't load OsuFile array fields until needed.
|     When cached, defer loading of timing points, breaks, and combo colors until directly before a game.  Potentially cuts loading time by 50%, and saves a bit of memory.
|     
|     Other changes:
|     - Don't store the default combo colors in the cache.
|     - Removed some PreparedStatements that only get executed once.

|     Added error() method to DownloadListener interface.

| | 
| |     Changed cached OsuFile loading.
| |     Instead of being loaded individually from the database, OsuFiles are now loaded in batch by traversing the database.  In most cases, this should cause a ~10% loading speed improvement.  Defaults to the previous approach if few OsuFiles are being loaded.
| |     
| |     Other changes:
| |     - Don't drop indexes upon batch insertion if few entries are being inserted.
| |     - Trying to increase fetch size with setFetchSize(100).
| |     - Added more parser statuses.
