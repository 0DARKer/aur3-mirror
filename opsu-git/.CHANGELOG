| 
|     Continuation of 53c79c5 - HitObject name changes.
|     Attempts to eliminate any confusion between OsuHitObject (raw, parsed hit objects) and HitObject (interface for game object types).
|     - Renamed "HitObject" interface to "GameObject", since these objects are specific to gameplay.
|     - Renamed "OsuHitObject" to "HitObject", since these objects are primarily containers for parsed data.
|     
|     Sorry if the name-swapping is confusing; these should be better names in the long run.

| 
|     Major refactoring - now using far more logical class names.
|     - Renamed "OsuFile" to "Beatmap".  All related variables and methods with "osu" have also been renamed to "beatmap" (or variants of each).
|     - Renamed "OsuGroupNode" to "BeatmapSetNode".  Avoids confusion since groups are identified by a "set ID", not a "group ID".
|     - Renamed "OsuGroupList" to "BeatmapSetList", for the same reason as above.
|     - Renamed "OsuDB" to "BeatmapDB", for the same reason as above.
|     - Moved classes directly related to parsed beatmaps (Beatmap, BeatmapSetList, BeatmapSetNode, OsuHitObject, and TimingPoint) into a new "beatmap" package.

| 
|     Changed font to Droid Sans Fallback v2.55b. (fixes #65)
|     Generally much cleaner than Kochi Gothic, and half the file size.  Uses an older version of the font, since many glyphs were removed in later versions (due to the glyphs being supported in other Google fonts).
