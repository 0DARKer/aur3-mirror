.SH "NAME"
ntdpal - Provides Primer3's alignment functionality
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBntdpal\fR [\-g\ \fIgval\fR] [\-l\ \fIlval\fR] [\-m\ \fImval\fR] [\-f1,\ f2,\ f3] [\-p] [\-s] [\-e] {\fIseq1\fR} {\fIseq2\fR} {\fImode\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Ntdpal (NucleoTide Dynamic Programming ALignment) is a stand\-alone program that provides Primer3\'s alignment functionality (local, a\.k\.a\. Smith\-Waterman, global, a\.k\.a\. Needleman\-Wunsch, plus "half global")\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-g\fR \fIgval\fR
.RS 4
\fIgval\fR
is a (positive) float (\.01 precision) specifying penaltiy for creating a gap respectively (the penalties are subtracted from the output score)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR \fIval\fR
.RS 4
\fIlval\fR
is a (positive) float (\.01 precision) specifying penaltiy for lengthening a gap respectively (the penalties are subtracted from the output score)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR
.RS 4
Causes the scoring matrix to be modified by dpal_set_ambiguity_codes\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR
.RS 4
Causes the end postion of the alignment in both sequences to be printed\. Do not confuse with the \'e\'
\fImode\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f1, \-f2, \-f3\fR
.RS 4
Force specific implementations\. \-f2 forces use an implementation that might provide more informative error messages, possibly at the expense of some speed\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Use a different scoring matrix: G and C matches = 3, A and T = 2, and mismatches = \-0\.5\. (The default scoring matrix assigns 1 to a match, and \-1 to a mismatch\.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Causes the alignment to be displayed on stderr\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 4
causes
\fIonly\fR
the score to printed\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR \fImval\fR
.RS 4
is the maximum allowed gap (default is 3)\.
.RE
.PP
\fIseq1\fR and \fIseq2\fR
.RS 4
are the sequences to be aligned\.
.RE
.PP
\fImode\fR
.RS 4
is one of
\fIg\fR,
\fIG\fR,
\fIl\fR, or
\fIL\fR
specifying a global, global end\-anchored, local, or local end\-achored alignment respectively\. For backward compatibility
\fIe\fR
is equivalent to
\fIG\fR\.
