# This version disables xinerama support, fixing two bugs: the impossibility
# to drag objects on the remote screen and the mouse pointer showing up in an
# unexpected position on the remote screen soon after crossing the defined
# border on the local one.
# See also https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=627164
# The patch proposed there, that disables dga support, does work too, but makes
# the mouse pointer move clumsily on the remote screen; disabling xinerama
# support seems to work better)
