DesktopBoost (dtboost) - Deamon for de/prioritization of processes on the fly

This README is specific for ArchLinux, general Reame is in source tarbal  
- you can find it in src/ directory....)


Please note, that you have to edit configuration file /etc/dtboost.conf  
to list critical applications you want to reprioritize, and few other things.

After installation try to run the script manually to watch what it prints out:
$/usr/local/dtboost/dtboost.py
that way it will run in verbose mode. Init script starts it in quiet mode.

For more information, see README in source tarbal.
