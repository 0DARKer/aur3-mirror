--> Please read the man page (man arch32-light) and the comments in the
    configuration files located at /etc/arch32.conf and /etc/arch32d.conf
    before using the chroot.

    Run "arch32initialize" to initialize the chroot.

    You may add "arch32d" to your DAEMONS array in /etc/rc.conf but this is
    normally only necessary if you intend to use "pacman32" as a non-root user.
