####### SOUND-CARD CONFIGURATION #######
#
# Please look in /usr/include/soundcard.h
# (search for SOUND_DEVICE_NAMES) to find valid device names.
#
# Mixer device: Default is /dev/mixer
/dev/mixer
#
# Capture DSP device: Default is /dev/dsp
/dev/dsp
#
# The sampling speed of the sound card's DSP. This should as 
# far as possible be the native speed of the DSP to avoid
# resampling, as it seems resampling distorts the signal.
48000
#
# Audio capture/recording source: Default is line.
# Alternative is usually mic or line1 etc.
line
#
# Audio recording level device: Default is igain.
# Alternative is usually reclev or rec.
igain
#
# Recording/Capture level: Useful range ~10-100. Default is 64.
# The correct value must be found by testing, see xdemorse.html.
64
#
# Sound card mode: (STEREO | MONO). My default is STEREO because
# I have two sources (receivers) connected to the sound card.
STEREO
#
# Channel in use by xdemorse: (LEFT | RIGHT). My default is RIGHT.
# When in MONO mode, this field is ignored. On my system at
# least, only the left channel works in MONO.
RIGHT

#
# Maximum Morse speed to decode. xdemorse is internally limited to
# the range 6-60 Words per Minute, but you might want to limit the
# maximum speed to a lower value, as this also reduces susceptibility
# to radio noise which can "drag" the current WPM to high values, if
# Auto speed detection and tracking is enabled. Default is 40 wpm
40
#
# Minimum Morse speed to decode. xdemorse is internally limited to
# the range 6-60 Words per Minute, but you might want to limit the
# minimum speed since a very low setting can "lock" the Auto speed
# detection and tracking to this low value. Default is 10 wpm
10
#
# Initial Morse decoding speed WPM. Should be between above limits!
20
#
# Word-wrap line length. Default is 60
55
#
# Serial port device for FT847 CAT: Default is /dev/tts/0
# IN MY SETUP! Please specify the serial port device you
# intend to use for CAT control of your tranceiver. PLEASE NOTE:
# CAT is available only for the YAESU FT-847 and FT857 which I own.
# If you are using some other tranceiver, there is no need to edit
# these entries BUT DO NOT ACTIVATE CAT as xfhell WILL ABORT!
/dev/tts/2
#
# Serial port device for FT857 CAT: Default is /dev/tts/1
# IN MY SETUP! Please specify the serial port device you
# intend to use for CAT control of your tranceiver. PLEASE NOTE:
# CAT is available only for the YAESU FT-847 and FT857 which I own.
# If you are using some other tranceiver, there is no need to edit
# these entries BUT DO NOT ACTIVATE CAT as xfhell WILL ABORT!
/dev/tts/0
#
# Enable CAT for Yaesu FT847 OR FT857 transceivers.
# Setting is FT847 or FT857 or NONE if you have some
# other transceiver or don't want CAT.
FT847
#
# BFO Tone frequency. This is the frequency of the receiver's
# audio output when a CW signal is tuned in the center of the
# IF passband. Because xdemorse uses integer arithmatic to
# detect the signal and to display the waterfall (by using
# an integer FFT algorithm), this value will be rounded
# in xdemorse to a value that keeps the above functions at
# a reasonable accuracy.
